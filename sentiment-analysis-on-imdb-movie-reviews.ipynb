      "1 \t\t I am one of the people who was not happy about the ending but I will not give a very bad rating just because of one single episode. It was a great show. I see people complaining how it is unrealistic and why Ted tells about the mother to the kids so long...What have those people been smoking? It isn't a documentary, it is a sitcom. Sure they talk about real life issues one can connect to, but they make it in unrealistic ways that makes it fun. For example, there sure are players out their, but no they don't have love affairs with their suits, have a playbook or do most of the things Barney ever did. And there are dads who tell their kids how they met the mother but they don't do it for 9 years rambling on about all the sex him and his friends had.I love the show. It had always brought originality and very surprising twists. There were episodes where I was really not expecting how it turned out. And this is usually not the case, especially not on sitcoms. We had some running jokes that stayed fresh and funny until the very end. References to past stories were usually well thought through and made the new story even greater.I loved the characters! Ted is the more normal one as he is the main guy looking for his love. But I never saw him as a boring douche (well at least not most of the times). he had charm and was a sweet guy who you wanted to be happy. I am usually not the main romantic but the sweet and perfect couple that Marshall and Lily were never made me want to vomit. They pretty much never disappointed me through the show and always made me laugh and feel the warmth for them. And as somebody who is not the biggest romantic I also loved Robin and Barney. Two people who are just not into relationships and yet they manage to give them more depth than just make them caricatures. All of them created by amazing writers and performed by very talented actors who made it all perfect.Here comes why I felt the ending was not fitting. It seems the show went on longer than planned. The ending they had would have been fine after season 5. But what they did with Robin and Barney made it hard to believe how easily they fell apart after being build up for seasons. It is hard for viewers to believe now that they were not right for each other after we saw them work on their relationship together. Would I rather never see their story or have a different ending? Easy! A different ending. I loved the seasons about Barney and Robin. So I am thankful they made it longer.Oh well. So hat there is one bad episode. 207 of them made me perfectly happy. I will really miss them now that I am done watching. So much sincerity (not the same as realism), originality, humor and also sentimental feelings combined in perfect balance.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother will go down as one of the better comedies of all-time (and rightfully so) but there's no doubt as to who's the best part of the show and that's Neil Patrick Harris (Barney)! He steals every scene that he's in and is funny in just about every episode. The entire main cast (Harris, Josh Radnor, Jason Segal, Cobie Smuthers and Alyson Hannigan) is great which makes this show so funny. The first season isn't as good so you may have to power through it out it's well worth it. Also, as most have already said...it has one of the worst finales to a show in the history of television! If for some reason you're one of the few people who haven't seen this yet then I highly recommend you do. It's almost impossible not to smile and have a good time during this show.\n",
      "0 \t\t One of the more original and funny sitcoms I've been watching. After all, if it was bad it would not last for almost a decade. I've heard they spoiled it near the end, but after five seasons I have absolutely no objections.8/10\n",
      "1 \t\t (note: I didn't start watching the show till this past fall 2013) This show is great, or was. There are so many great episodes to mention here that really just a few wont do it justice. Seasons 1-5 were fantastic, 6 and 7 were blah, 8 had it's great moments, and 9 was a waste of time. I binged watch this show anytime I had the chance because I wanted to see the finale on live T.V so I didn't have any chance to see major spoilers. But I have to say, I probably could have waited and just took my time with it. It didn't need to have 9 seasons but there were even moments in the terrible series finale that I adored. And let's be honest it's a complete rip-off from friends in terms of it's characters and where they end up. But before giving my overall opinion I will go through the main cast and give my opinion on them and where they ended up.Lily: Ah, the heart and soul of the bunch. She always stuck with everyone (except for Marshall briefly) and made us cry more than anyone of the group. Besides Neil Patrick Harris, Alyson Hannigan was the best in her role and by far the most emotional. Even when she was pregnant, still very attractive and had some of her best lines with the baby. Her relationship with Marshall is one of the best on screen couples in recent memory. lily is the one who never wanted the group to separate, even when they are old and gray. I really love where she ended up at the end of the series and have no complaints at all. We still love you Lilypad.Marshall: The second funniest of the group and the second half to the best T.V couple. Who doesn't love Marshall? Always their giving Ted advice and constantly slapping Barney. Jason Segel was great, even if he really didn't want to a 9th season, he still showed major heart and hit the right emotional highs and lows. He finally became a Judge! The Pineapple Incident (could be the best HIMYM episode) was his best episode and by far funniest. We salute your hilarity and wish you good luck at your new job. Case closed! We still love you Marshmallow.Barney: The best part of the show by far. In a role that is similar to Joey's on Friends, he made the womanizer role his own and even in his despicable moments gave us real heart. Even though he's our favorite, he's also the most disappointing because of where the writers sent him. He came so far as a person transforming himself as a person only to be sent back to his womanizer days as the show ends. We still love you Swarley.Robin: Is this Rachel? the answer is no. The writers try to make her out to be by shows end, but in reality she's just not the same. Robin Sparkles will also be remembered as one of the most outrageously funny ideas. But in the end I will remember her as the wanna-be Rachel. I realize the writers said they planned for her character ark from the start but it would have made more sense if they ended with season 7 or 8. Don't make an entire season with Barney and Robin's wedding and more then 2 seasons just on their relationship, then convince the audience it's a red herring. A movie maybe, but a T.V show just doesn't work like that. We still love you Robin Sparkles.Ted: The guy who everybody on the planet can relate to. He's not the funniest, but he is the reason we love this show. Because he makes us feel truly emotionally attached to the entire cast with his narration (even though it's Bob Saget). This guy spends 9 seasons looking for his \"the one\" and does he really ever find her? The mother or Robin? I loved the chemistry between both couples but the writing just didn't all fit. They could have handled the mother's demise better and even his re-up with Robin. Anyway he had great scenes with Marshall in the college flashbacks and overall I think his chemistry is best with everyone. None of the other characters can say they have as many good scenes with the entire cast. We still love you Teddy West-side.I can go on and on but I really wanted to focus on the cast because that's what we will remember, or at least what I want to remember. I had high hopes for the ending because of the great Friends ending, but there are still so many re-watchable episodes that I really cant complain.INTERVENTION 9.4/10\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show to binge watch. As it is mainly all flash backs it doesn't even have to be in order\n",
      "1 \t\t I cannot begin to explain how much I love this TV show. It is freaking brilliant. I loved it more and more each season, but unfortunately, the final season was my least favorite. Here's my order from best to worst. Season 3 + 5 (tie), Season 4, Season 2, Season 6, Season 1, Season 7, Season 8, Season 9. I love the simple idea of a man telling his children how he met their Mother. It's such a simple idea. I do have to say that there is only one episode I hate, in the entire series. That's a pretty good ratio. Sadly, the series finale was a disappointment, and I won't go into detail, but it's not what I or the rest of the world expected.This show is about Ted telling his children, in the year 2030, how he met their Mother. He starts in the year 2005, where he hangs out with his best friends, Lily, Marshall, Robin and Barney. He tells them of all of his girlfriends, and possible \"ones\", all of his conquests and downfalls in life. How his career changed, how his family changed, and how everything changed. In the span of nine years, a lot of stuff went down.Overall, I give this TV show a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother will go down as one of the better comedies of all-time (and rightfully so) but there's no doubt as to who's the best part of the show and that's Neil Patrick Harris (Barney)! He is funny in just about every episode. The entire main cast is great which makes this show so funny so if for some reason you haven't seen this yet I highly recommend it!\n",
      "1 \t\t It was indeed a very good and entertaining series.They really went crazy in the final episode.\n",
      "1 \t\t Its just the best, the way it starts omg it takes all your attention until the end, some people didn't like the ending but the ending was okay coz ted always belonged with robin.\n",
      "1 \t\t Greetings,I know it's weird, but I have to confess it. Maybe I'm not the first guy who confess his thoughts about HIMYM.First of all, I want to thank for everything it's taught me. First time I watched How I Met Your Mother TV Show, some thoughts are started to appear in my mind. It's very strange to tell, I don't really know how to start or how to describe it. It's like panic attack, you can't describe it too, you know. But these thoughts are good. I started watching in 2005. As you know start day is September 19, 2005. If I remember true, I started on October. Anyway, I have no idea what will happen in this show in the future. I have never expecting to watch it for the last episode. This show is different then others, it's teaching many things to it's followers; friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity et cetera and et cetera.To tell you the truth, I did not establish a deep friendship until now. I tried too much, but why is it not work, really I don't know. I don't know. Ted, Barney, Marshall, Robin and Lily taught me too much things about friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity. I learned more. Until now, I learned that there are too many things that I must learn. You look like you have too much free time in my country. But in the end, there is a free time they seen but you have not, and they are steal your free time for nothing... Instead of this, I can travel to more country, and learn more. I can work more, more and more for me and my family, friends... It's started eat my mind.Anyway, as I said, I have watched How I Met Your Mother too many times. And this show, these cast and the team, who are stayed background, taught me too many things. I'm still continuing to watch this show on TV. Even I realized that, I have to own bundle box of this show. I found a site, and I will buy this bundle.Maybe you said, \"I don't understand why you are yelling?\" Believe me, there are some things that can hurt. HIMYM helped recognize myself. I believe that, all of these main cast is reflects an idea. Ted is ambitious for his dreams. If you believe, you can do anything. Barney is looks like lecher, but he is not. Just like Ted, he is looking for a door to happiness. Lily. Ah she is adorable and interesting person (but she is very professional to hide her thoughts). Robin is unperturbed, but she is very professional just like Lily. She is hiding her good feelings during some situations. Marshall is childish, and this is a virtue too.As you see, I discovered these emotions in these characters. All of them was a very good lesson for me; Always be an ambitious, and release your emotions while reaching to these dreams. But at the same time, be lecher for your dreams. Do interesting things and do not listen/see what people talking about yourself about these situations. And of course, don't forget to do some childish things. This will make you happy.Thanks for reading. And best regards to How I Met Your Mother TV Show cast and the team, of course!\n",
      "1 \t\t Hello everyone! I have to say that I really really love the series! Especially, I love the couple Barney-Robin so bad! I learnt a lot from the gang and I really love them. I cried with them, I laughed with them, spend every moment with them. Really, I cried a lot when Marshall's Dad died, and when Tracy died, I was broken :( and I had a quite tough day after. I used to think that the season ninth may be the season that I like the most, but turned out, I was wrong @@ The moment Robin said: \"We got divorced\" made me cry :(( I don't know if I'm a sensitive person, but I cried a lot. And then when Ted stood under Robin's apartment, holding the f**king blue French horn...I was totally speechless. I spent a whole day after cursing the directors, I really did that -.- All I can say is that I was totally disappointed by the end of the series. But after all, we can't forget the contain just because of the ending. So I decided to see the episode 22 is the end, or at least the last five minutes were just pretending. Anyway, thanks for reading this!\n",
      "1 \t\t Carter Bays and Craig Thomas created one of the more intriguing sitcom premise. Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) is telling his children in the year 2030 of how he met their mother. Back to today, he is a hopeless romantic and an architect living in NYC. He falls for Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders) and he has a group of friends (Jason Segel, Neil Patrick Harris, Alyson Hannigan).It started out as one of my favorite all time sitcom. The premise led to all kinds of great speculations on who the mother is. However by the second year, it was obvious that they didn't intend on getting to the mother until the very end. I understand the need to do that. They probably feared that the show would crumble without the conceit that Ted is always looking for true love. The problem is that it made a surprisingly engaging sitcom into a very safe long running show.*****************************************************EDIT after the show finaleMy opinion is that the final season is mostly disappointing. However I'm OK with the final reveal. At least it explains everything leaving it wrapped up reasonably. The biggest problem is that the finale is all rushed. I have no idea why the whole season is stretched thin to the limits doing just that short period of Robin & Barney's wedding. Why not spread out the last episode into the last half of the last season? There were about 10 reveals crammed in the last episode. Each one could be a hilarious episode on its own.\n",
      "1 \t\t With a show so funny and entertaining I was sad to see Ted Mosby and the gang break up.When I first watched How I Met Your Mother I surprisingly thought it would be one of those shows to get old with age. While some people thought that the shows final season had sucked I thought that it was great The ending as you probably know is Ted telling the story of what turns out to be his dead wife to his kids and the kids realize he should be with Robin and he steals the blue French horn yet again and wins her back. Many may have been disappointed with the ending but I like how Ted finally ended up with robin after almost thirty years of friendship and awkwardness. The minute I saw Robin I thought there couldn't be a more perfect match for Ted I was happy for them yet still sad to see the show leave. Barney Stinson is by far my favorite character on the show besides Ted. I was happy that he finally found happiness in his accidental child. How I Met Your Mother is a masterpiece and you are insane if you don't watch it. (I recommend this to anybody over the age of 12.)\n",
      "1 \t\t Such a beautiful, funny, heart-warming & interesting show to watch! The characters are GREAT, their relationships so intriguing, love every sub plot, 10/10!\n",
      "0 \t\t All I can say is, \"Thank you for the laughs!\" This show took me through a broad spectrum of emotions.Now to give a thorough review: Seasons 1-5 were brilliant. They were full of inside jokes, funny college flashbacks, laugh out loud antics, relatable relationship mistakes, and even some \"d'awww\" moments. The show was the kind of stuff that made you wish you had friends as awesome as Ted, Robin, Barney, Lily, and Marshall! Writing, dialogue, and character development was sharp and the characters, though set in their ways, seemed to always be put in the right comical situations.My gripe with Seasons 6-9? The show just got long in the tooth. There wasn't enough fuel to sustain it; it was running on fumes. Jokes were being recycled mercilessly, flashbacks and scenarios started to get more and more far fetched and less funny, and Ted's relationships became far less interesting (Jeannette anyone?). The characters' idiosyncrasies which had charmed and entertained me in seasons 1-5 were now boring me. Long story short, the show lost its freaking mojo. Instead of enjoying each episode and wondering what would happen next, I would trudge through episodes half-heartedly just waiting to find out \"How He Met the Mother.\" I think the breaking point was when Ted decided to go back to Victoria for the third time...I had just about had it...Seriously? The end of season 8 and all of season 9 were in my mind complete garbage. The writers, actors, and viewers gave up in my opinion. The timeline of season 9 (mostly taking place the 55 hours before the wedding) was just borderline torturous. Speaking of the absurdity of the final two seasons, Daphne? That was such a dumb distraction from the main plot. Although the whole show was built around distractions from the plot, they just stopped being funny...Daphne is a prime example.One of the biggest mysteries of the show is what the hell happened to Marshall's character? He started out being witty, funny, and although slightly obsessed with Lily (who could blame him?), he was his own man! By the end of the show he was reduced to the role of saying a stupid one liner every episode (which were never funny). He lost his edge. By the time the show wrapped up and he became a Supreme Court Justice, I really did not care. Big Fudge? More like Big Dud.THE ENDING (Pure personal opinion here with no technical basis)I really, really liked the Mother aka Tracy. I think she is incredibly beautiful and I would want her to be the mother of my next child...That awkward statement aside...WHY OH WHY did she have to die? She was the ONE for Ted. The show wrapped up season 9 (easily the worst) by making us fall in love with her, informing us she died in the last 4 minutes of the show, and THEN hastily (6 years in 10 seconds) showing us Ted moving on to Robin...Really? Robin and Ted SUCKED as a couple. No, Robin SUCKED as a partner. I liked Robin separately, but Ted was too good for her! Long story short, I'm really butt hurt that Tracy was dead.THE ENDING (Technically speaking) God, it was so rushed and poorly crafted.Due to the pressure that networks like CBS, FOX, and NBC put on TV shows to perform in certain time slots, it was only natural that the ending to \"HIMYM\" would end up being botched. The show was of course incredibly funny, but once viewership started to drop (people lose interest over time), the show was relegated to a different time slot until it was probably given a cancellation notice. A show like \"HIMYM\" which meanders as much as it did the first half of its run was forced to \"resolve\" its plot relatively quickly to the build up which is why IMO the final season was as disappointing as it was.Overall I want to thank \"How I Met Your Mother\" for giving me a TON of laughs. I totally downloaded \"I Would Walk 500 Miles\" and still get a smile every time it plays! I also have to say that the show somehow always managed to assemble the most incredibly gorgeous women that I have ever seen in starring and supporting roles. I have many good memories from the show, but I just wish the last few seasons were one of them. The last 50 episodes definitely were tough to get through.I'd definitely recommend this show to a friend, but more for casual watching than binge watching.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a brilliant television series with a very well developed and detailed storyline that spreads out in to nine seasons and an outstanding comedic cast.The character development is outstanding,we learn so much about Ted (Josh Radnor),Robin (Cobie Smulders),Barney (Neil Patrick Harris),Lily (Allyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segel) throughout the course of nine years,you learn to love these characters very early on in the series and hope for the best for all of them as we watch their future progress,the show came out a year after the final season of Friends,and it was certainly a great replacement.The series last season is certainly the worst of the nine,I'm not going to lie,it made some risky choices that might not have worked out as well as the writers thought,I'm not sure how I feel about the last episode,it contradicted a lot of character development and had an unanswered question,after nine seasons,you would expect everything to be wrapped up.It will hit your funny bone as well as your heart,How I Met Your Mother is a fantastic series that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great comedy series. Follows the story of Ted Moseby,as he tells his two kids the story of his life leading up to the day he met their mother. Best Performance: Neil Patrick Harris Worst Performance: Britney SpearsBest Episode: The Final Page: Part 2 Worst Episode: Slapsgiving 3: Slappointment in Slapmarra\n",
      "1 \t\t Hands down the best show I've ever watched. The gang are simply amazing. You can't help but love each single character. The plot has been flawless even though I'd have loved a better ending but I believe it's the most sensible one since they had to shoot it after season 2 so that the kids don't look older 7 years later. The writers have done such a great job and The fact that they've covered every single detail in the show makes it terrific.\n",
      "1 \t\t What sets this apart from other sit-comedies is how wholesome and poignant it is, at times it doesn't shy away from taking a more emotional dive. This is something I appreciated about the show and made me connect in a deeper level. As a person who despises laugh tracks, I softened up with this show and it helped that the laugh track was very rare and not forced into the show.The show is just about Ted Mosby's journey on finding his true love, it also follows the characters of Marshall, Lily, Robin, and Barney. But Ted Mosby remains at the crux of the story. There is a sense of cheesiness when you put it out this simply. But that's what makes the show so beautiful in my opinion. The show basks in it and acknowledges the cheesiness and reinstates one's faith in destiny.The actors all performed to the tee of what is expected of their characters. I found them to be quite appealing, although Barney's antics were unappreciated and aged quite poorly despite him getting ridiculed by the gang. I think Marshall was the most likeable character, all other characters had their flaws and their is nothing wrong with that. But Ted's journey to find his true love is designed in a simply beautiful way.The most significant and major debate regarding the show is known by all and that is the finale of the show. Now my thoughts going into it on a binge knowing the backlash was that it's not bad at all. It was really unexpected, but not terrible by any means. The thing is that it felt like it undid a lot of character development and the set-up that Robin and Ted want different things out of relationships so don't make sense together also fell out the window. Barney finally changed his ways and Robin got a chance to settle, it just felt like all the character development was thrown out the window. Although someone did point out this was a little risk and gamble taken to give a not so happy ending and show despite so much work sometimes things just don't go the way we hope. Despite hearing this reasoning and all, I feel like it just undid a lot of development from wanting different things, to undoing arcs, and breaking the joy of the Mother who was built up and hinted at through the glimpses of destiny. It's just unfortunate and took away from what the show was building up at. The finale also seemed to go very quickly and would have been better if it was more fleshed out across a few episodes instead of getting some of the bottle episodes in s9.Overall not an ideal ending at all, but it wasn't as trash as I expected so that's good. But it's worth remembering that the finale isn't a reason to quite watching the show. We can change the finale in our head canon or replace it with the How It Should Have Ended version. I highly recommend this show as something in my top 5 (could have been a 10/10 in my top 3 if not for that ending).\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is the first sitcom I really got into. I remember watching episodes with my gf and didnt get what the big deal was. Then I watched from season 1 and totally got the hype. I was immediately drawn into the characters and their lives. Marshall and Lily became my dream couple and Ted was the perfect lead character for this show. The way they turn his pain into comedy is perfection. The guy is literally searching the entire series for a partner, and they somehow make it the most interesting show I've ever seen. Barney is hilarious and makes the perfect \"dirty friend\". The fact that he's a womanizer makes it even more hilarious. The only reason I didnt give it a 10 is because the final season felt rushed, which I know they had to because Jason Segel wanted out of the show. I loved the mother and loved the fact that he ended up with Robyn at the end. If youre looking for a feel-good, hilarious show, give it a shot.\n",
      "1 \t\t Really funny. Loved the characters and the story. The thing about this show is it isn't to consistent. The first and 8th season aren't anything special and season 9 just isn't good and this show has one of the worst finales of any show. But all the other season are amazing and hilarious and I've re-watched it around 10 times. Definitely worth a watchSeason1 7.5/10\n",

      "1 \t\t What can I say about this show? The cast is awesome. The writers rock. The show is great. My favorite character is Barney. He is probably the main person I watch the show for. He is funny and brings a certain \"something' to TV that it needs. It is totally the best new comedy in awhile. While it does have a laugh track - it isn't needed. Bob Sagget is right at home on this show playing the Dad. I think it is very fitting for him to be playing that role. The rest of the cast is great also. The guy who plays Ted is great at being the 'every day' guy and Marshall and his soon to be wife, Lilly are perfect together. As for Robin, well she is Robin and there is nothing wrong with her. I think everyone on this show including the regular cab driver are great. This show has everything and I hope everyone gives it a chance. I love it. It is legendary. Till next week Barney.\n",
      "1 \t\t When \"How I Met Your Mother\" first appeared on the small screen, I refused to watch it. But then I watched an episode (I think it was Episode 5 when they went to a club) and a thought it was pretty funny. I must admit that the new show isn't laugh-out-loud, slap-your-knee HILARIOUS...but it has potential to be great! Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan's Lily (due to her previous comedic roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I'm sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that's what makes him lovable.All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they'll start tuning in as well. Everyone always compares this show to \"Friends\" which didn't really get popular until after the first season. Hopefully, this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations. But WATCH IT!\n",
      "1 \t\t I recently found this on disney and thought I'd give it a go and I was not disappointed, I ended up binge watching it all over a few months and I loved it, every single night it had me laughing.I loved the idea of the show straight off, getting to see everything that was going to happen would happen for a reason, believing that fate does exist and it all built up to Ted meeting his future wife, I'm an old romantic at heart and that really appealed to me.The characters are all great but for me Barney stole the show, as I said they were all good but he was legen..... wait for it..... dary.The last season building up to Barney and Robin's wedding was such a relief because those two definitely belonged together and I was so happy to see them finally get married.So all good up until now, then we have the last 2 episodes, which in my opinion make it the worst ending to a TV series ever, after literally having the entire last season building up to Barney and Robin's wedding and them finally getting married in episode 22, in episode 23, a few years later, they get divorced, all that build up basically for nothing, why couldn't they have stayed together and had a happy ending, they both deserved it.Then we come to the very last episode, after all this time, 9 seasons, 208 episodes we finally see Ted happy and it should've been a nice episode but instead no, we basically get a massive mule kick to the gut and they end it finding out that Ted's wife died a few years ago and nobody seems bothered about it, he just said she got sick and the kids say she's been gone for 6 years, nobody, apart from us viewers, seemed sad that she was gone, she was a good character, really nice and perfect for Ted, then the kids just tell Ted to go after Robin because he obviously still loves her. Ted and Robin were never meant to be together, they were never a match, if he was to end up with somebody other than Tracy then he should've ended up with Victoria in my opinion.I am so gutted those last 2 episodes ruined a fantastic seriesI'm still giving it a 9 though because there's an alternate ending out there which should have been the actual ending where Tracy doesn't die and that's the ending I would like to believe.\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't know if I have enough to say to fill up ten lines. I basically wanted to say that I think this is a funny show, and I hope the network keeps it. I especially like the twists and sense of mystery.I've liked Alyson Hannigan for quite a while, and I think she's doing a great job in the first adult role I've seen her in (I can't believe she's already 31). I also think Doogie, I mean Neil Patrick Harris, plays his character really well. If you haven't seen him in \"Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle\", you should. Josh Radnor also does a very good job in his first leading role.I agree that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but I think this show has a lot of elements that make a good series: good plot, good writing, good acting, and attractive cast). I think previous series like \"Friends\" have raised the bar very high for new sitcoms, but I hope that even if a series isn't destined to become the next \"Friends,\" it can still be recognized as a good and worthwhile sitcom.\n",
      "1 \t\t Aaaah.....first and foremost it is the only sitcom that is regularly compared with friends time and again. So, it wizzes past all the rest sitcoms in my opinion. Now, the main question which is the best out of these two. Can you watch both these shows endlessly CHECK. Do they have awesome characters CHECK. Do they both portray New York as the best and the most jubilant cities in the world CHECK. Only thing they do not have in common is the path to ending they have taken. If you want a fairy tail ending, Friends is the choice and if you want a bold take, then himym is the way to go.In conclusion go watch either of them. They will give you endless hours of laughter and are legendary. Ain't sitcoms about that. LAWYERED XD.\n",
      "0 \t\t I loved this show. Unfortunately, the ninth series is increasingly putting the past tense into that statement. The whole nonsense of having Marshall travelling rather than present is tedious. And he really is important to the group chemistry, which is increasingly unbalanced. The flashbacks are getting contradictory. Dragging out 3 days into a whole series is just stupid.It is still watchable, but there is none of the magic or the emotional investment that has been present in the first 8 series. And now we have seen the Mother and having her as a permanent recurring cast member, why can't we just write her in properly and get on with having Ted meet her?!\n",
      "1 \t\t If you are low on patience you probably will have an issue with the whole, when will we finally meet the mother. Now if you were lucky enough not to have been spoiled a couple of things, good for you. You still have to bring a lot of endurance and a lot of time. If you like funny shows, this one is pretty good and I guess it's the closest to Friends we've got since ... well Friends.It wasn't planned to go on for 9 seasons as I've been told, but the show was so popular, they couldn't help themselves. Now as with Friends there might be single episodes that you like more and some that you may not like that much. But throughout the 9 years this was going on, this held a pretty high standard. It even is possible to do a \"binge\"-watch. Because while not really much of a character development, there is at least quite a few things that are happening.Many comparisons to Friends are evident and I don't think the writers would mind that much. There's always repetition at times, which is a bit odd for binge watchers (and also the kids listening), but the show also makes fun of that when it can. Good fun and good show overall\n",
      "1 \t\t I had waited a long time to watch HIMYM for the first time, actually very long after it ran.I had to binge it in a very short time. It was instantly addictive.Recently, I rewatched it, thinking it might have gone stale after the first watch.Boy, was I wrong.It got even better. And here's why:You can imagine the writers saying:\n",
      "\"I have SO many good jokes, but it's impossible to put them all into one episode.\"\n",
      "\"CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!\"The range of jokes spans high- and low-brow humor, every legen- wait for it - dary wordplay ever, and sophisticated storylines that are almost impossible to guess.So naturally one viewing doesn't even make you remember a tenth of all lines worth remembering.It spawned a lot of similar sitcoms that all were only kind of good in comparison - and may I say: Big Bang Theory is almost a poor ripoff of the nerdy aspects of HIMYM.I am glad I watched this one last.Not only is the cast perfect, but this series has one of the most memorable characters of all times: Barney Stinson, brilliantly portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris.Next to him, Sheldon Cooper looks kinda lame even.Also, the series spans much more of life than you might initially think.Apart from the wacky side, it also touches very serious issues. (But mostly, it's good fun.)So, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. There will be no regrets.Or rewatch it every three years. You will be surprised what you missed or forgot about.If you are a writer: we need this kind of stuff. This is the Shakespeare of sitcoms.\n",
      "0 \t\t I have to admit that I created imdb account just to rate this show after watching it.\n",
      "0 \t\t Watched the show, thought \"Hm, I haven't decided if it'll stay or not\". But then the next day, my husband and I are quoting it and want to watch it again. We try again the next week, again with the quoting. I haven't watched a show where there are lines that stick with me like this for a very long time. The show wouldn't be anywhere without \"Barney\", but somehow none of its faults matter because I enjoy it just too darn much. Every episode there's a new line, haven't been disappointed so far, hoping it continues and gets even better.I mean come on, with lines like: \"Suit up!\" \"Phone Five!\" \"Not awkward guys, its only awkward if we make it awkward\"And the numerous variations of \"suit up\" are a hoot \"Snow suit up!\" \"Flight suit up\" I gotta say, I just enjoy it. There isn't great philosophy, it has a laugh track, but I don't miss it and end up watching the episode a couple times because its the only things worth watching sometimes.\n",
      "1 \t\t SPOILERS******I think too many people took the title of the show too seriously. A lot of people wondered why Ted decided to sit down and tell his kids a story about meeting their mother which included his ex-girlfriends. Well without some of the girlfriends, he would not have grown and become the man he did. He also would not have lucked into the opportunity of meeting their mother. And without those stories we would have not had a TV show. The show has a great combination of funny and heartfelt moments going on that I've only seen matched with Friends and Scrubs. There were some episodes along the way in season 7-9 that were forgettable but a lot of shows get like that when they're on past their prime. Now that I know the full story and that Ted ends up with Robin, I want to watch the entire series over. To me it makes perfect sense to end the show the way they did, because Robin was a main character to the story and not necessarily so with Tracy. It was clear through most of the series that Robin was the one that got away from Ted and the one that had the biggest impact on him. Robin helped make Ted into the man that the kids saw and helped shape him into the man that would fall in love with their mother. Barney's story was also very interesting. A lot of people felt that the writers undid all of his development in one show. The thing I like about what they did, was that it felt real. Barney's character was complex. He had been let down throughout his life and had his own very deep seeded psychological problems. Those were not necessarily gone by the time he married Robin. I think they were still within him, hence the jokes that he was still able to make about other women's boobs and so on. The thing Barney gained from his relationship with Robin was that she helped him love someone. She helped him see that he was capable of doing so. Little by little, Nora, then Quinn, then Robin helped Barney see that he was capable of more. I think Barney was heartbroken by his marriage with Robin. He felt that it was going to be a certain way. He was as excited if not more excited than her to be married to each other. Hence his nervousness leading up to the wedding and how perfect he wanted it to be. I just think that he couldn't handle what their relationship was becoming kind of like the first go around. He loved her too much to lie to her. But he learned how to love and become a bit more stable. His 31 day spree after his divorce was more about him going to a dark place than it was about him wanting to be that guy. The other thing is that Robin never would have been able to give Barney a child. His daughter was the love of his life and I found that sweet. She changed him forever. Going back to Ted and Robin. What people might forget is that present Ted is telling the story and not past Ted. People felt like he wasn't genuine in his love for the mother Tracy. I think he loved her with every ounce of his heart. Present Ted was 6 years removed from his wife's death. He wanted to tell his kids the story of how he met the most incredible woman of his life. The only problem was that there was more than one woman that had that effect on him. He just didn't realize the effect Robin still had on him and how important she was to him. His kids helped him realize that. He wasn't the only person in the story who loved multiple people. Robin fell in love with two different men and Tracy had fallen in love with Max before Ted. The show was very real in that sense. So to sum it up, the mother was a Macguffin but a very beautiful one and one that helped the story have a direction. The last scene b/w the mother and Ted where they finally met was beautifully written and acted. And the final scene to me has not stopped running through my head. The music hit, and Robin brought out the romantic side of Ted again. No words needed to be spoken there and I'm happy for that. We all knew and in the end I was happy b/c these fantastic characters that I've come to love were all in a better place.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show was incredi wait for it... ble it was incredible I loved it I should just start with the characters first we have Ted, an architect searching for his one true love being the kids mother. I loved this show its so great, the perfect sitcom after seinfeld and friends.My favourite character is Barney, he's the one character who gets the funniest lines in this show, definately watch this, its a show that is the perfect love story... the question is whos story is it?\n",
      "1 \t\t I am writing this review after 3rd marathon of all seasons. So I am not a critic who talks about how it should have been but a common audience who just loves it. Its a big write up so get ready. For 'Friends' comparison scroll down.One thing I like about this show is the audience laugh in the background. They're at the right levels. Unlike the some shows where audience have to laugh at crap, HIMYM was just played to audience after making hence you'd find the laughs exactly at the write moment and well timed.You want to laugh out loud, you got it. Need a ride into a whole new romantic world, you got it. Learn some life lessons and be inspired by moments in the show, you will feel it. The show's characters are not newly written instead they're huge upgrade on what we already know. Editing is done brilliantly as the plot moves from scene to scene from set to set. Director certainly know what she is doing and you have to commend her abilities to do it consistently for 9 seasons. Writers, take a bow. The characters just don't make random jokes and sarcastic punchlines instead they behave how you imagine one would in the real world.Now to the actors, I watch a lot of Sitcoms that are comedy and romantic but I feel a connection this show. Ted Mosby played by Josh Radnor is the soul of the show. His character has so many shades that everything written for him just suits him (He never suited up). He is just flawless. Jason Segel as Marshall, you wish you have a friend like him. He brilliant and looks at ease in every scene he was in. Never disappoints for 9 seasons. Allison Hannigan as Lilly is one of the best actresses out there. She pulled it of effortlessly. Lilly has the best chemistry with everyone on the show. Cobie Smulders sparkles through the show. She is perfect as Robin and you'll fall in love with Robin from the pilot. Robin's character brings out what we see in people regularly. Loving, hating people, snappy decisions about life, rigid mentality, idealistic. It is hard to imagine anyone but Cobie Smulders as Robin. She can emote well in any type of scene. Finally, if Ted is the soul of the show then Barney is everyother thing. Neil Patrick Harris, my man take a bow. He can dance, sing, act, does magic. There is nothing he can do and no words can describe his acting. He deserves all the awards that have come to him for Barney. Without Barney this show would be a romantic weep show. Barney is legend Neil Patrick Harris dary. People often compare it to Friends and magnify similarities between the two but it depends on your connection to the characters. I feel that the characters are more dark in HIMYM. Each of them have more layers and subplots for the background and how they behave. Yes there is larger than life comedy but its comedy. Friends is more into jokes and funny dialogues where as HIMYM is more about the plot. Call me biased but after watching both, I felt characters in HIMYM have more depth than those in Friends. Every scene and dialogue in Friends has calculated amount of jokes where as in HIMYM, every scene leads to the next one directly. Both are great shows and it is unfair to compare. I prefer HIMYM as I can relate my life and friends more with it.Hope you'll like it too.\n",
      "1 \t\t This review will fall into two pieces, inspired by the latest 2 episodes ( seriously guys, what the f... is going on with the musical bits and ridiculous rhyming).Until season 5, somewhere mid-season 6: some of the best comedy I have ever seen. Hilarious, right on the spot, with great one-liners and characters. Absolutely wonderful.Anything after that: what the f... went wrong? Lame jokes, terrible musical bits, awful dialogue, just plain awful TV. And yet somehow, I am still watching, just to see the last episode. Com' on guys, this should have finished 3-4 seasons ago: on your epic legendary peakness.Thanks for all the wonderful laughs, but wow, you really overstayed your stay!!\n",
      "1 \t\t \"HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER,\" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. One of my favorites would have to be the episode where Bob Barker guest-stars. If you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off CBS, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.\n",
      "1 \t\t HIMYM series is Legen... wait for it... Dary!The first time I watched it was on Fox channel (Star Channel) recently, and it was soon one of the episodes that I loved the most, and that became one of my favorites, which was the ep of Marshall's last slap on Barney (in the last season). \"And that, kids, is how I\" decided to watch HIMYM, and I ended up loving the series! I laughed a lot, many scenes were heartbreaking... Anyway, the worst part of it all is that the series ends. Has one of the best and most amazing casts ever, super talented actors, a great dubbing (in portuguese BR), and a beautiful story. It's much more than just a series, there are not enough words to describe, it's one of my favorites and it means a lot to me.08/20/2022.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of my favorite shows! It has a little drama, it's funny, it has heart! I laugh and cry when I watch this show! I love each and every character so much! This is definitely a feel good lighthearted show! My favorite episodes are the ones where you finally meet the mother and then they show you all the scenes from her end! Season 9 is the best season IMO! I'm not crazy about the way it ended but the more I watch it the more I understand why they ended it the way they did and it makes sense. It's funny how you can fall in love with characters so much that when it's over you feel like you miss them and get a little sad! That's how I feel after I finish watching HIMYM. I re watch it at least once a year! Although I'm not in love with the ending I still give it 10 stars because it's so well written and heartfelt!\n",
      "1 \t\t Broadcast television has offered some wonderful sitcoms over the years - some of which like I LOVE LUCY, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, MARY TYLER MOORE, TAXI and CHEERS are still in reruns years or decades after their network runs. They are truly classics but HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER definitely is not.I see nothing funny going on here. Most amazing to me is that anybody buys openly gay Neil Patrick Harris as a suave, sex-crazed womanizer. GMAB.None of the characters is appealing or likable - they're even less appealing than the one dimensional, self-centered bunch on SEINFELD or FRIENDS.Complete waste of airtime.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show!! It's one of the best sitcoms on the air and one of the best CBS shows!!! I disagree with the other comment - Barney is the best character. He's the funniest person on the show. I love how the entire ensemble has chemistry together!! It actually feels like they're friends in real life. And I don't think they need new writers, they just need to grow a little more. This show gets better with time. I laugh so hard with the show that my sides hurt every time I watch. I recommend this show to anyone that has a great sense of humor and wants to laugh until their sides hurt. I hope that this show has a long run on the air.\n",
      "1 \t\t Network: CBS; Genre: Sitcom; Content Rating: TV-PG (some language, suggested adult & sexual content); Available: DVD; Perspective: Contemporary (star range: 1 - 4); Seasons Reviewed: 3 seasons Just when you think the sitcom might just roll over and die, it gets a spark of ingenuity from the most unlikely of places. Rarely have I seen a show with such a deceptively lame concept come off so fresh and imaginative in it's execution.Set in the future, \"How I Met Your Mother\" is told entirely in flashback, as a father Ted (voiced by an unseen, uncredited Bob Saget) tells his children a lengthy story that answers the title question. The answer to how he met their mother is found somewhere in the New York misadventures of a 20-something Ted Mosby (Josh Rader) and his closest friends: long-time couple Marshall (Jason Segel, \"Freaks and Geeks\") and Lilly (Alyson Hannigan), Canadian local news anchor and Ted's love interest, Robin (Cobie Smulders) and Barney (Neil Patrick Harris), a professional bachelor who has turned dating and life management into a suit-wearing contact sport in which he reins as the king of awesome.What starts out as yet another sitcom about hipster singles in New York with a useless gimmick evolves in the 2nd season into a modest little sitcom masterpiece. Creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas pull the flashback format in every imaginable direction. Flashbacks inside of flashbacks and the true story content censored for Ted's children are just a few of the tricks Bays & Thomas have up their sleeve for this nonlinear story.Also around season 2, somewhere around neo-classic episodes like \"Ted Mosby, Architect\" and the brilliant \"Slap Bet\", the cast gets comfortable with each other and tightens into one of those classically solid ensembles. All 5 of the leads hold up their end of the tent. While I choke with disgust on the ever-popular and wildly misused critic's adjective \"lovable\" (usually reserved only for Judd Apatow shows) they are all pretty darn endearing. Attention goes to Rader for taking what could have been another boring straight man role and giving him all the colorful idiosyncrasies usually afforded to supporting characters. If anyone thinks Robin is the weak link, that gets blown out of the water with spectacular bit of less-than-flattering comedy Smulders performs at the end of \"Slap Bet\" - to date the show's single funniest moment.But the gold metal (and a few deserving Emmy nominations) should go to Neil Patrick Harris who aggressively cements Barney Stinson as the character he will be remembered for - instead of that other one. Barney is wacky, to be sure, filled with funny one-liners and quotable catchphrases, with a mushy humanity underneath. From bits where Barney explains the \"hot/crazy line\" or \"the platinum rule\" or doing a David Letterman top 10 about the names he would have called a moving van, it's a miracle that Barney doesn't become a black hole that sucks up ALL the show's jokes. Barney is larger than life, taken to hyperbolic extremes by the show yet grounded by Harris. It's a great performance of a well-written character.The show is charming, delightful and clean in a way that wouldn't suggest how edgy and laugh-out-loud funny it also is. \"Mother\" is the best example since \"Seinfeld\" of a show that is able to do an entire 30 minutes on something decidedly adult (venture the third season episode \"Third Wheel\" about threesomes) in a way so clever it could still be viewed by the entire family.Yes, the single scene in New York is ground that has been trampled to death. I don't need to tell you all the places we've seen this before. Yet, \"Mother\" amazingly finds new avenues to explore. \"Single Stamina\" feels very \"Sex and the City\" yet entirely fresh. The exterior sets could be from \"Seinfeld\" yet fit the show perfectly because it has proved to have a genuine love for New York - not just using the city as a another backdrop. The flashback and multiple-POV jokes? Yes, \"Coupling\" did them, but \"Mother\" does them just as cleverly. From it's guy-centered exploration (even elevation thanks to Barney) of the single life to it's beautification of New York to it's clever storytelling structure, any way you slice it \"How I Met Your Mother\" is on par with the best of them.Yes, \"The Office\" may get all the hip network buzz and \"30 Rock\" gets a lot of critical acclaim from a press that is oddly hesitant about acknowledging this show's achievements. I'm taking equal delight in \"Mother\". It's such a joy to watch this show consistently hit all the right notes. It's funny, it's got heart, it's unpredictable and it's go wit to burn. Do not let TV's best studio-audience sitcom pass you by.Wait for it",

      "0 \t\t Great up until S5, good in S6-7, awful and unrewatchable from the very start of S8... What a shame\n",
      "1 \t\t I've enjoyed the first few episodes of this post \"Friends\" comedy. It really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty-somethings are finding themselves in these days.Alyson Hannigan once again presents her hilarious, quirky sense of style and humor. Along with her boyfriend, Marshall, they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the \"not still partying like college kids, but trying not to be all grown up\" stage of life.The lead character, Ted, provides great entertainment. Audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability. He's not desperate to get married, but merely ready to find the One, tired of game playing.Overall, I think this is a half-hour well spent. The humor is edgy, unpredictable, and you will find yourself reminiscing about those first few years after you graduated from college and struggled to find yourself out in the \"Real World.\"\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is told in a sort of flashback way by Ted the main character who's explaining to his kids on how he met their mother. Ted is an architect, the other main characters are Marshall a lawyer who's married to Lily a kindergarten teacher, Barney the ladies man and Robin who works as a television reporter. The writing on the show is sharp and fast paced, even going and tell the same story from the perspective of multiple different characters on the show.While Ted is technically the main star of the show it's Barney who's the real scene stealer, Neil Patrick Harris has created a character that he himself would describe as \"Awesome\" or \"Legen...wait for it..Dary\".\n",
      "1 \t\t The temptation for see the serie was, at beginning, the presence in the cast of Neil Patrick Harris. After a couple of episodes, it was a must see for me. Sure, it reminds Friends. And it is a film about and for adultuscents. But it is more than nice. It propose mechanism of relations, stories of love, accidents, errors, fears, vulnerabilities, a world full of energy. And a lovely chaos. It is amusing and challenging and naive. Like many of its viewers. So, a serie. About the beginning of an universe.\n",
      "0 \t\t I bought all seven seasons on DVD because my coworkers raved about how funny this show is. OK, I wasn't impressed with the pilot, and now that I'm on season three, I can say without a doubt that this rehash of old ideas doesn't get any funnier. In fact, I have yet to laugh at a single joke.To be fair, if they got rid of Ted (fiery car crash, anyone?) and canned the writers, the rest of the cast might have potential. Neil Patrick Harris, Jason Segel, and Alyson Hannigan are certainly knocking themselves out. But let's deal with what we've got, rather than what it could be.What we have is clearly a rip-off of Friends, among other shows. \"Vomit free since '93\"? Seinfeld. Pretending to be a tourist in your home town in order to pick up women? Seinfeld again. And the moustache fetish/attraction from the tattoo removal episode? Threes Company. I could go on.And speaking of the tattoo removal episode... Seriously, it takes the doctor TEN weeks to tell Ted the reason she won't date him is because she has a daughter and thus devotes all her time to her child. Who writes this nonsense? A normal adult would just tell the guy the reason in the first place... But then that wouldn't open up the situation for all kinds of hilarious hi-jinx, now would it, kids? These so-called \"adults\" live a goofy, adolescent lifestyle, like no university graduate I've ever met. It's almost like a 14-year-old girl's fantasy of what awaits her after she graduates high school. I'm actually embarrassed for the writers and embarrassed to be watching this show in my early 30s. At least the twenty-something characters on Friends acted like adults with real careers.Which brings me to Ted, who is perhaps the most annoying main character in modern sitcom history. I can't stand him! What twenty-something male spends all of his time obsessing about getting married -- especially when he hasn't even met Ms. Right yet??? And surprise, all the women on the show are attracted to him, like he's Brad Pitt. In fact, all the girls in the bar look like models and are one-dimensional air-heads who ALWAYS instantly fall for our overly-nice drip of a main character.Barney: \"Have you met Ted?\" Perfect-ten female with googly eyes *falling all over herself*: \"Hiiiii Ted!\" Speaking of annoying, the limo/cab driver with his stupid fruity smile and \"Helloooooooo!\" catch-phrase makes me want to join a fight club. Apparently there's only one cab driver in this juvenile fantasy version of New York city.Add to this the endless flash-backs-within-flash-backs, and you've got the most pretentious recycled garbage that ever survived a pilot episode. Make no mistake, this \"romantic\" (read cornball) comedy may have fooled some of the less mature viewing audience -- those who are too young to have seen good comedy -- but this will NOT stand the test of time. I hope the writers and producers are enjoying the money while it lasts. I sure as heck will avoid any turkey their names are attached to from now on.In closing, if you're checking this show out for the first time, I recommend watching the episode \"Dowisetrepla\" with all of its \"is what I should have said\" and it's \"is what I did say.\" If you find that hilarious, then this show is definitely for you. Enough said.\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the show i just completed literally just completed and oh man last episode i am gonna cry at last 5 min if watch this it totally gonna worth it for 9 seasons this series have fun, emotions,drama, everything in life just amazing i don have words to tell how great is this show how season is they doing awesome and there's season 9 it realise how really life is i think that it should be continued for one more season how they end up specially Barney at his 60s hitting on a girl it would be interesting. I think was going to be lengen........wait for it.......dary if they make one more season.\n",
      "1 \t\t I absolutely despise this show. My reaction may be the same as others had to a show, \"Oliver Beene\", from the same creative team. I liked \"Beene\" but i cannot tolerate the smug/smarmy/cloying unfunny drivel put forth here every Monday night. The cast seems put together from people who make good second and third leads but are here asked to carry a la \"Friends\" the who load themselves and are just not up to it. Neil Patrick Harris is a marquee name I suppose but he makes his character the least convincing heterosexual since Niles Crane. Unlike David Hyde-Pierce did with Niles Harris imbues his character with absolutely none of the likability Niles had. If you think \"Dharma And Greg\" displayed the cutting edge cleverness of \"Seinfeld\" or that Gallagher is the equal of Richard Pryor or Lenny Bruce then this show may appeal to you. It makes a good pairing with the equally unfunny but much better cast \"Three And A Half Men\". Unwatchable\n",
      "1 \t\t Kids, today I tell you about how I met my friends.I'm warning you I haven't watched \"Friends\" (but I really tried and it seemed too boring for me) and I can't objectively compare it to each other (Every comparing will be nonobjective)!First, characters are awesome! They are growing (seems they are younger than \"Friends\", it's weird that adult 40-year-looking persons live together), dreaming and developing. Their relationships are developing with them. They are not perfect, but this is exactly what makes them absolutely brilliant and makes them your best friends for the next 9 seasons.Second, it's legen... wait for it... dary catch phrases! It occupies your brain and you begin to use them. We people often copy habits from our friends.Third, it's full of feelings. It's essential to feel you are alive. The series touches your heart. You smile, laugh, cry. Every episode is exciting and makes you feel full spectrum.ATTENTION! There is a little SPOILER!One thing freaked me out. It's a mother (Tedd's wife). She is perfect and looking unnatural. Looks like her character was created in a hurry. She has no soul. She isn't your friend and she won't be.So, kids, that I met my friends.\n",
      "1 \t\t An extremely funny story, manages to completely capture you and fall in love with the characters. The immense problem is in the last season, being entirely around a wedding, which makes everything extremely tiring and unnecessary, it could be boiled down to 1/3 the size. The end of the story is something abominable and totally unnecessary, sad, simply incomprehensible. It seems like there was a risky gamble in creating an entire season around one topic, which was clearly a bad idea and ruined the outcome of a great story that could have had a great ending. A word of advice, watch only the first 8 seasons and forget that the last one exists, as it doesn't add anything.\n",
      "1 \t\t Watch series if you want to laugh and enjoy time watching something, I'm watching it third time the whole series but trust me it's worth it because it is Legen wait for it Dary...\n",
      "0 \t\t I used to be a huge fan of How I met your Mother. I thought the show was brilliant. It was fresh, different, with new faces and had a really cute story line. I swear, the first two seasons were hilarious. The 3rd season wasn't too bad either, and now that they are running re-runs of season 1-3 on TV where I am, I've learned to compare the show from then and now. What happened, dear writers, producers, directors and actors?! How I met your Mother at its later season is just becoming dreadful. Obviously the writers are struggling to give it more staying power on the airways, but prolonging the episodes with extremely annoying story lines are really going to throw your fans off. And worst still, the show isn't funny anymore.I mean, honestly, adults at their age in real life do not at all behave like that. Instead of adults in their late 20's, they're all beginning to sound like clumsy aloof teenagers. It's really getting very annoying. And Ted, who was very likable in the beginning episodes, has gone to this pathetic, needy, clingy and whiny plus boring individual. And then there's Lily and Marshall, who are married now and are trying to conceive, but have gotten over the top mushy with each other that it makes me gag.Barney's probably the only person to watch for in the series. Although I vouch that it will get old soon. How many more women can he sleep with? How much more of a sleaze will he become? As for Robin, well, I had no confidence in her staying on in the show, and she truly brings no chemistry or any presence at all. If she weren't in the regular cast list, I still think the series could have taken off. She'd probably do better as a guest star.Some of the episodes don't even make any sense, no was there really any reason to turn it into an entire 20 over minuet episode! It just contains extremely boring and annoying sequences that have been repeated too many times throughout the other seasons. I don't even find myself smiling once with the newer episodes.And as some of the reviewers have said here, with 6 seasons running, none of them have really made any progress throughout the years. I am sad to see this show go down the drain. As to those who compare it to FRIENDS, I'm afraid this show will never come even close to being how amazing and funny FRIENDS was. With good shows like HIMYM turning horrible, I'm surprised good comedies like Gary Unmarried have been canceled, and time slots are given to comedies that have deteriorated.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is the first TV series I've ever watched. One of my friends introduced me. At that time, she was translating this TV series to our native language. She told me to watch it because it really helps you to improve English language skills. And that's why I watched it. Thanks a lot to that friend for introducing such a great show. Otherwise, I wouldn't have known such a great show existed.Some people might think that HIMYM doesn't have anything much in it. It might be very very boring and so on. But if you watch it carefully, you'll see there are a lot of interesting things in it. Their friendship and all, they make people feel warm. So, don't judge if you haven't watched it or not watching carefully.As I've said in above, if people say HIMYM is for entertainment, I would rather say it's for educational purposes. The dialogues they used in this TV show are so natural and it can be used to educate in the English speaking field. They way they talk isn't that fast and you can easily catch what they are saying. If you add subtitles, you can also learn the words. That's why I say it is more suitable to use for educational purposes than entertainment.This TV series is indeed a great show. But not flawless. There is something I don't like of this show. And I think this is one and the only one flaw. The writers of this show shouldn't have done it. I wished they didn't do it. At some point of the show, it is clearly stated that Robin lived in Barney's apartment and she got two kids with him. But at the end of the show, Barney and Robin broke up and there wasn't any kid. Not talking about two, even a kid, they didn't have. Furthermore, they stated that Robin can't have child. So, what they stated previously, and what it turned out in the later episode(s), it is completely opposite. It shouldn't be like that.As much as I would like Robin ended up with Ted, I don't like the way they changed the whole plot in the end. I mean once you have established the plot, you must stick to it. You can't possibly change it. Otherwise, the whole thing is ruined as this show is. So, no matter what, Robin and Barney must be together and have kids rather than they broke up and Robin ended up with Ted. And I also don't like the writer(s) killed Ted's wife.All in all, if there is no such thing in the show, I'd say it's one of the best TV series I've ever watched. But now, I can only say it's a fine show and also it's the best one it you're looking for materials that can help you study English language.\n",
      "1 \t\t Am currently on my 10th watch all the way through and will never get sick of how great this show is! A lot of people hate the ending but I love it as it makes perfect sense why he is telling the story in the first place.Every single thing in this show has either a subtle callback years later or is explained in detail in future seasons and that's why I love this show so much! Not one thing is forgotten about or left out.And the fact that he ends up with robin finally is what everyone wanted for him through all 9 seasons, especially after the bet about them ending up together.If I could rate this higher than a 10/10 I would.\n",
      "1 \t\t CBS has done it again..a fresh new comedy, and right out of the gate, the chemistry between all of the main characters feels settled in, like they have known each other as long as the story alludes to.The premise: Ted's best friend has just gotten engaged, and at the age of 27, Ted is starting to feel that \"settle down\" kinda feeling. And it's his friends mission to help him find that perfect woman!! The voice of Bob Saget plays the \"future Ted\" who is telling his teenage children all about \"how I met your Mother\"...and he does a great job of interjecting the humor, embarrassment, terror and ultimately, the pilot ending Surprise,in a kind of \"Wonder Years\" type format that suits this whole concept very well. Josh Radnor plays Ted, and is a great comedic actor, with very good timing, and very believable as slightly bumbling yet definitely desirable man ready to start out a new life.Neil Patrick Harris plays the lovable, yet obnoxious \"other\" best friend Barney...and his performance was great!! What a comedian he is!! I look forward to seeing more of him in this well written role!! Alyson Hannigan plays Lily... for all you Buffy fans, you will appreciate and enjoy the new comedic talent that is coming to light in this great young actress.Jason Segel plays Marshall..Ted's Best Friend..again, another good fresh comedian who has spot on timing, and just compliments this ensemble cast perfectly.I haven't been this excited about a comedy since Friends...I hope that this does well..with the surprise ending that it had, I can see how they can possibly take this show into a fairly long run with lots of fun twist and turns. I hope they can come up with a lot of them!! I am definitely watching this one again!! Bravo CBS!!\n",
      "1 \t\t this was one of my favorite shows for a few years, but now it has grown old. when you are in your mid 20's and the world is waiting for you then you have your laughs etc, but these guys are in their late 30's or close to 40. when are they going to grow up and act their age?it is sort of sad not funny.the characters are not very realistic and they grown old and stale , the jokes are not funny , the original cast seems dull,the new cast members are not likable-the stripper in particular.perhaps lily and or barney marshall should move to the subs, and ted should find his true love, as for barney he should hat meet someone tottally opposite a religious kook that converts him to religion.or else they should all ride off into the sunset.\n",
      "1 \t\t well. if you just look at the title, its most likely you would think its some crappy show that will probably be cancelled the first season for being extremely lame and incredibly boring. honestly, i felt this way about this show when i saw what it was going to be called..\"How I Met Your Mother\". Come on. thats what most people would expect.well, if people gave it a chance, its actually a really cute and hilarious sitcom about the main character Ted pondering on his love life and looking for \"the one\". Josh Radnor I've never heard of before, but i really do like his humor in the show. it's a strange kind of humor to me though, almost dry humor. The supporting characters give great comedy to the show, esp. Neil Patrick Harris' character Barney. (who's my favorite character in the show). Man, his character cracked me up in the pilot. I laughed continuously when everyone kept on dismissing his ideal of them all wearing suits. Its great that Doogie finally comes back to television in a great new series. Their are other great characters i feel give great comedy to the show such as the couple Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segal) who make a great team. They have those romantic, but hilarious scenes together where you have those laugh out loud moments. Then you finally have Robin (Cobie Smulders) who is seen as \"the one\" at first, but turns out to not actually be Ted's future wife. She has her funny moments, but i don't really see her as funny as the rest of the characters.Thats basically what people need to know about this show. Most of the actors we have never heard of and haven't seen in movies or shows in awhile, but this is great stardom for them. It's a great show for everyone to watch for it has great comedy and writing to it. It's nothing really what i expected though when i saw the previews for the pilot. Just give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed. It def. has a potential to last some more seasons.\n",
      "1 \t\t Patrick Harris is amazing as Barney Gumble in I think you should leave your mother. The man who's is so straight. Pick up artiste extraordinaire. I love have you met ted. I feel as though I have now thanks .\n",
      "1 \t\t Nothing more to say. Covered by some \"cool\" characters a puritanic, old-school morale gets transported, and the people like this waste of time.It's like \"Friends\" in the 2010's, but without any message nor any real funny moment.If you like this \"the real love is beautiful and worth to wait for\" soft-washed stuff, do this. But it's material for the people who don't like thinking, sorry.Not worth any comparison to intelligent shows like \"The Big Bang Theory\".\n",
      "0 \t\t I have to completely agree with the review written before me. This show used to be very good, very funny and unique, but that's all in the past. I've just watched season 8 episode 20 and it was god-awful. A pathetic attempt to fill another 20 minutes or so. And they say there will be a ninth season! Do I really want to watch that? Well, I probably will, but only because otherwise I just wasted countless hours of my life. But you can be damn sure I won't re-watch the show. 20 years from now I will still remember the great shows like Friends, Seinfeld but HIMYM will be just another blurry, fading memory of a show with a really long title that started out good, but the writers didn't know when to stop. I BEG YOU, PLEASE STOP DRAGGING OUT THE STORY!Update: Now it's S09E11 and I've just watched another god awful procrastinating episode. Thank god this is the last season, with only 3 more episodes to go.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've just finished re-watching all 9 series in an attempt to distract myself from all the ugliness we have around us at the moment.The first time around I had rated it a 9 so I had really loved it even then, although I remember thinking it was dragging on too long and really needed to wrap up.This time though I didn't want it to end and the rating went up to 10.Season 9, which I previously thought of as tedious, was wonderful and that final 5mins of the last episode was completely perfect television.Do yourself a favour and start - or restart - watching this!\n",
      "0 \t\t One of most horrible shows of all time. I do not even understand how this show got 8.6 rating. Does not deserve a 5. The characters are totally confused. And how many times Robin will jump from Barney to Ted. Since 7 years the characters have not grown even a single bit. I am bored to death seeing every episode having flashback shots. Marshal and Lily are utterly boring couple (though they are good for each other but such a couple should definitely not be the center characters of a sitcom. Barney's cool character has started to bore me since season 5. and there are so many loopholes and unnecessary twists that I can just - How I met this F***** Up Show.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of a kind, tremendous, emotional, greatest sitcom of all time even better than friends . If you are still mad about ending just ask a question to yourself wasn't this obvious.\n",
      "A great love story was developing from season 1 to 9 yes Ted met Tracy but even if life is perfect\n",
      "stuff happens and then what it's not like Ted ran behind Robin the very second after the death of his wife there was 6 years gap between, like Tracy found Ted after the death of her love Ted found Robin after the death of his love that doesn't mean Ted and Tracy weren't perfect . Tracy's death , it was a worst scenario but life goes on.\n",
      "1 \t\t First of all, to everyone raging how they hated the ending: Come on people, it is a TV show, for crying out loud! Get over it!For me the ending was brilliant! At least it explains Ted's twisted story-telling and why it took 8 seasons before we actually got to meet the mother. And true, it was sad that she dies, but Marshall's dad also passed away, which i found way more depressing. Having Ted show up at Robins apartment with the blue horn was bittersweet and basically brought it to a full circle. Barney finally committed to a female who will turn out awesome, when she grows up. Marshall and Lily are the perfect couple as you always knew they would be.I congratulate Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for having the courage to not end HIMYM like any mediocre sitcom would and want to thank them for almost a decade filled with laughter and sometimes tears (sometimes both at the same time) because the characters they created felt multi-layered and so real at times you wished they were actual friends you could hang out with at MacLaren's pub. It never got boring to watch, even if Ted seems a bit whiny sometimes and when re-watching the show you finally notice that Lily is a bitch. Having said that I'd like to send a virtual high five to everyone involved in making this show. It was legen-... wait for it...-dary.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show is awful with predictable jokes and cardboard cut-out characters. As I was reading other reviews for this show on IMDb I shocked to discover that this show was being widely heralded as 'the next big thing'.In one reviews I saw this show being described as 'funky' and 'hilarious'. This show is neither it boring and disposable. It is appropriate to describe this show as boring due to the predictability of the characters and their 'hilarious' retorts to each other; overall a complete clique. Even the attempt to differentiate this show from a thousand others in sitcom hell (by using a father looking back in hindsight and explaining to his children about \"How He Met Their Mother\") is tedious and lame.Essentially this show and a thousand ones like it are far and away past their sell by date and it is incredible to believe that s**t like this is still being produced.\n",
      "1 \t\t Honestly, I get those who lower a star because of the bad ending but as a whole, How I Met Your Mother is probably the best sitcom ever made! It's the set of characters which even if flawed, will end up in the right decisions. Because this is a spoiler-free review, I'm not gonna say anything about the plot throughout the seasons but what I will for sure say is that season 1 is only the tip of the iceberg, it's just a very lighthearted season but a fair warning of things that may or may not come! It's honestly the show that always cheers me up because it's always either funny or has a LEGENDARY moment that is truly meaningful. Forget everything about what the last season is and just enjoy the ride...and may I say, the ending had some reasoning and there's still an alternative ending out there in the web, which was included in a DVD special.Honestly, this show is made for everyone and it's always fun enough to laugh and emotional when needed. It might be the best sitcom as it has everything...drama, comedy, and characters who go through amazing arcs.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is so worth watching! What great characters and amazing writing! This show is a Hit! Finally something to tune in to on Monday nights. Not since Friends have the characters on a sit com bonded like this. I love that there are 3 guys and 2 girls..The writing is fresh and in control and productive.....I particularly enjoy the Ted with the shirt episode - what a unique story line and all the characters just seem to work so well together. I love the added suspense of \"who is Ted going to end up with\". The character of Ted does an amazing job! He has such a cuteness and innocence about him that makes the whole premise of \"How I Met Your Mother\" really work and keeps the audience so tuned in to find out what is going to happen next! You have accumulated such a great staff of writers!!! Amazing new show! Our office is taking turns staging Monday night soirees to watch! This premise really works! Keep us the good work! Keep Monday night TV rolling along! Yeah!! Hilarious!\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is the epitome of well planned, well casted and well written. The foreshadowing in so many of these episodes is incredible. The ending of Time travellers, Farhampton, and many of the season cliffhangers are incredible.The only downside of this show, is how rushed the final episode is. The final season spends so much time building up to a wedding, only for it to all be revoked in a few moments at the end. It's not the divorce that I hate with the ending, of the death. It is how rushed it all really is, and ultimately Ted should never have got back with Robin. Which I understand is super hard when this was all planned from day 1 (including many of the season 9 scenes with the children) I would have preferred refilling the characters and trying their best to keep them look the same age if possible.No one could have ever accounted for how much the audience was going to love the mother, or her chemistry with the shows protagonist and narrator.Outside of the ending. This show is incredible, the foreshadowing of the future, the fact that it is a sitcom with an actual background story. I love friends and Seinfeld but they can't compete with why I love HIMYM. Maybe not as funny, maybe you don't love each character as much. But the culmination of all of these things and the dedication to a story, and the real tragic elements of life, love and growing old, is why this show is a top 3 show of all time. Adjust a few small moments in the ending and it would be #1.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show isn't more popular, because \"Seinfeld\" exists. If somehow Jerry had opened a bagel shop, rather than becoming a comedian, this would still not have existed, or would be a crummy ripoff of some other show, say \"Night Court\", or \"Gidget\". Such an absurd revision is this, that they even steal lines DIRECTLY from Jerry's series, i.e. in one episode, Ted drunkenly claims that he is \"Vomit free since '93!\". Jerry Seinfeld claimed he was \"Vomit free since '83!\". It doesn't end there, but it should. Neal Patrick Harris needs to be read the riot act. He is completely unfunny, totally predictable and damages ever scene they insert him into. Josh Radnor, although he tries, is terrible. Nobody is that naive, not in NYC. There have been times I would have strangled the two of them if only I could have gotten my hands into the TV screen. Cobie Smulders is very beautiful, but she has nothing to do. Her character, as well, is one of the most annoying ever on a sitcom. \"I don't love Ted! Or do I?? Maybe I do! NOOOO.... I could never love Ted, I have a career! Or DO I....?\" Enough already! I get the idea! You can't make up your mind and Ted is a MORON!! The only thing that works on the series, is the relationship between wonderful Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel, who actually seem well suited to each other. Naturally the producers turn their characters into a target at every turn, making their relationship look stupid, their devotion seem hopeless... it is beyond belief. I also hate the openings, where an older Ted tells his kids, who obviously are waiting for their allowances, \"How I Met Your Mother\". It's a one note gimmick and it keeps the show from going anywhere whatsoever (not that this sad trash has a destination). Despicable junk, CBS needs to surgically remove it from it's schedule.\n",
      "0 \t\t Wow, I cant stand this show. It is just the epitome of a bad show. I would rather watch commercials, and in fact, i often do, every time this is on. just ridiculously stupid characters whose voices i cant stand talking about the same blah blah stuff constantly. i literally want them to shut up. I cant even have this show on as background noise because i get irritated hearing that characters stupid voice going on about some pointless unfunny drivel, and it seems to be the same every episode.i cant understand how people watch this? I cant understand how this got made in the first place I cant understand how it got so many seasons i cant understand why networks are airing it!whoever wrote this - you are probably the most irritating person alive.\n",
      "0 \t\t What happened to this show?!! This show has run it's course.. Just like the office did! And just like the office, only the first 4-5 seasons were funny. They should have quit while they were ahead! HIMYM should have ended about five years ago!! Maybe if it did, it would have ended with dignity and people would have respected it. I stopped watching. But some people I know are just watching because , and I quote 'they feel like they have to because they followed it for so long' but they all say its terribly unfunny now and disappointing. I mean really Carter Bays do you want people to watch your show because of that? Don't you want everyone to watch it because its funny and original? Terrible, terrible, terrible.. And sad part is - seasons 1-3 were awesome and hilarious. Sad\n",
      "0 \t\t I was told that if you like Friends, you'll like How I met your mother. The show is now on Netflix, so I thought: \"Why not.\" I have no idea how this show has been so popular and I'm wondering why on Earth people compare this to the epic comedy: Friends. very boring. And to be honest, I didn't feel it had a cohesive storyline, and the people or the story didn't seem to get anywhere. Just a bunch of separate \"jokes\" and moments. I wasn't excited about the ending of the first season and didn't even realize, when Netflix started to roll the second season. To me it felt the same all the time...And the characters just seem to lack personality.What bothers me the most, is that the jokes and characters have so much similar things as Friends. Every time something familiar came up, I was so annoyed and thought that couldn't the writers really come up with something different and original. Too many times I kept thinking \"I have seen this\" and \"Are you kidding me, you stole that from Friends\".Just to name a few...*One thing that annoyed me the most, was that nobody quite knew what Barney's job was and that was one of the main things of Chandler's character. Seriously, the writes should have NOT used that joke here!*The others are calling Barney Swarley, and he hates it. In Friends Chandler wanted to be Clint, but everyone kept calling him Gene. Barney's and Chandler's reactions are very similar. *Marshall and Jill (the \"main couple\") want to get married in Casino. So did Monica and Chandler. *Barney is womanizer, so is Joey. They both have sex with older woman and have a crush on their friend's ex (Robin/Rachel). *Robin and Ted are having a hard time to make their relationship start. So did Rachel and Ross.This was definitely not a TV-show for me... Totally waste of time.\n",
      "0 \t\t When Friends ended in the U.S the networks obviously came to the conclusion that they needed a new one and from that we get How I Met Your Mother a show that is very very similar to the legendary sitcom.Characters, situations and at some points even story lines have all been pinched in order to generate humour which by the way is in very short supply in this sitcom.Of course because it's popular its been dragged on and on with the characters getting more and more stereotypical and fake. At some points you wonder if you are ever going to find out who the mother is and really do we care?If this and Two and a half men are the top rated sitcoms in America then I feel sorry for the viewers.\n",
      "0 \t\t At the beginning this show WAS really entertaining, funny, good jokes and everything was in place. But it turned out like bad friends. I guess they decided to prolong finding \"Mother\" just because of popularity. Everybody sleeps with everybody and that's normal and they are \"friends\" after all no matter they slept each other. Seems like only Marshall and Lilly are normal in this. I really hated when Ted decided to leave Victoria because of Robin. Should we abandon our partners because of dumb friends? So immature.Also, forced jokes in last two seasons (7/8) are so bad I won't watch this anymore, just the last episode to see who that perfect women is. Shame, it had potential but failed HARD!\n",
      "0 \t\t I'm amazed that there wasn't a lawsuit for copyright infringement. The shows are identical: A few guys that use too much hair gel that all have the same personality. Two hot chicks with good hair. An opening theme song that's sweet enough to cause diabetes. The womanizer. The couples with their relationship up and downs. The lame jokes. The laugh track that follows every predictable joke.It's all there. The only thing that's missing is the oddly colored wall paint. And to kick it all down one notch, it's narrated as if it all happened in the past... although it looks as if everything, the clothes styles, the interiors, etc. are all present day. They could have at least try to match the \"past\" time frame look and feel. But no. Apparently meant to appeal to the fans of Friends who don't have the ability to think too deeply and are entertained by cuteness and shallow characters.\n",
      "1 \t\t Season 1 and season 2 held promise to me from it having a group of friends that were humorous at first. Then after season 2, it felt those same people were in denial about who they truly were. Also, how the mother of Ted's children died was suspicious to me when Ted finally went back to Robin after he got the desired kids. Otherwise, Barney became increasingly boring when he wouldn't be honest about his feelings and thoughts completely. So, I dismissed him from my attention. Lily, played by Alyson Hannigan who played on a, to me, better show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer before season 5, seemed to have split personalities. One minute she's nice. Another minute she's rude. I wouldn't trust her, especially how she went into that financial fiasco with her excessive shopping. Robin is a crazy woman that hurt Barney, Ted, etc. and her father didn't help as much as he could have to prevent her from leading Barney, Ted, etc. into this on and off again abuse. Marshall was the only almost relatable character until his characterization was butchered after a while. Even though I saw a short video of Barney's evolution on YouTube that made me feel somewhat sorry for him, I still had a hard time liking the characters in this show enough. I don't think I could be able to be friends with them regardless of their shortlived humor before season 3 after what they have done to fictional people.\n",
      "1 \t\t How i met your mother is one of the single greatest sitcoms ever created . I really really loved💓 and enjoyed this show . The show depicts on how the cycle of life works , explaining how we meet people in life unprepared and before we even know it they become inseperable . Besides being entertaining , HIMYM was so informative and so worth the time . The cast was just 💯 perfect . I'll always cherish✨ these moments and someday I'm definitely gonna rewatch this show and it would be \" Legen.......(wait for it)........dary....!!Legendary!!\n",
      "1 \t\t If you are a fan of two and a half men and friends, you will love this. 1-8 seasons are amazing. Season 9 is really bad. You may skip to last episode just to see the end.\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the series especially that you feel a bit lost when you try to find out who's Ted's wife is gonna be. The storyline takes you back and forth. Will Ted end up with Robin or Barney will?\n",
      "It's quite funny and you'll enjoy watching this series.I felt sometime that there are lots of common stuff between HIMYM & Friends. Lots of \"plagia\" there.\n",
      "0 \t\t I cant say how much I love this show and eventhough I rewatched it over and over again it just feels like \"home\" watching it somehow or just listening to in the background. Its a tv show from a time where you could actually make jokes without ppl being offended. It has no forced PC agendas and its just real somehow. Ofc barneys character is over overexaggerated but people with normal mental health know its just comedy. The jokes a funny, the characters are great especially marshall who is my favourite character!You really grow to love this show with every rewatch you do and it doesnt get boring. Its a feelgood tv show with some good life lessons :)Sadly this kind of show will never survive in todays times so THANK YOU for creating this and leaving this for us to watch whenever we like and whenever we are annoyed and bored of the boring shows and political correct forced crap they force upon us today.\n",
      "0 \t\t I've watched this show before I even knew about friends and I found the show funny. But than a few years later I've met friends, watched it too and figured out that this show is nothing more than a really really bad replica of friends. If you want to watch it, don't bother and go watch the original one with original jokes.\n",
      "1 \t\t The characters are fantastic (Ted is my current mood) , it's a really funny series, completely in american style. There isn't a bad moment and the most beautiful things are the life lessons by Ted, first of all when Robin is looking for her ring.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of the best series I have ever watched. I just love Robin, Ted, Marshal, Lily, and, wait for it, Barney Stinson. The first five seasons are especially too good.\n",
      "0 \t\t I just finished HIMYM and let me say that everything you have heard about the ending is true. It is unbelievable how badly they messed this up. I loved every minute of this show, even the last couple seasons that were not as well received. But they lost me on the last episode. I'll still enjoy rewatching some of the earlier stuff but the way they just totally got rid of all of Barney's character development, divorced him and Robin like it was no big deal after dedicating an entire season to their wedding, ruined Robin's character as well by showing her to suddenly be incapable of living independently, KILLED OFF the character the previous nine seasons had been building too, and worst of all had Ted and Robin end up together after proving they couldn't work just totally ruined the show for me. Rant over.\n",
      "1 \t\t This series helped me learn so much about relationship and life\n",
      "0 \t\t I've given this show several chances but it just hasn't blown me away. I watched the penny episode, the Barney runs a marathon, Lilly not wanting to invite her dad for thanksgiving, Lilly camping out for black Friday (and sorry if some of these are the same episode, it's just THAT random & hard to remember when there's no plot). Like when Marshall gives Robin and Ted his last Barney free-slap and they argue the whole episode on who should slap him, it's soooo boring and pointless. Like 1.They can slap Barney whenever they want to, they don't need this intangible \"pass\" to do it 2. If they really hate him so much, enough for Ted to admit he still loved Robin, then why the hell are they friends with him? 3. Robin, Ted, and Barney have been in a love triangle and this slap scenario is REALLY hard to believe considering their association. It seriously lacks continuity and makes me believe that they're just adults bored af desperate to do any whimsical thing in a non-satirical way (Sunny in Philadelphia does a great job with satire) but HIMYM does it in a super serious way. I don't need to know Neil Patrick Harris is popular to see that the writers are really milking his character. Since I haven't seen the older episodes, I never got to experience the cool Barney cus now they overuse him and it's annoying! He's not even original. Every comedy has a guy who wants all the ladies. And Lilly with \"that son of a beesh\" (is that her catch phrase?) It's not funny! I can sorta see what she's trying to go for but she just doesn't say it right. I was glad to see It's Always Sunny in Philly has a higher rating because it's very bold and controversial. The actors are fantastic. They could have the most boring dialogue but their comedic timing and intonation can turn it into a memorable quote.\"Making Einstein and everyone before him *slaps label on drawing board* look like a Bitch!\"-Mac. They're real life friends, they know what they're doing, and they're not afraid to look ridiculous. HIMYM characters fall short in personality, all the characters are average (aside of Barney who has some color). Even Big Bang Theory has more uniqueness (I don't even like it but I prefer it over HIMYM). The pace is slow. Seriously I wanna know what I'm not getting? I know people who like it and they talk wonders of it. But what's so funny about these average characters in average situations with random discontinuity? I'll give it more chances but it for sure doesn't deserve an 8.5.\n",
      "1 \t\t They ruined the best character of this show Barny, what is the point of showing him evolving and then suddenly changing back to beginning , and ted-robin together ? Seriously? Robin said she doesn't love ted and ted said he have no feelings for her multiple times. I watched this within 2 months time , i feel for those people who watched it for 9 years.\n",
      "1 \t\t When it comes to sitcom we all have heard about Friends, Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld, Brooklyn nine nine etc., but if you are searching for a sitcom that want to trigger you emotionally with romance, friendship, family.., I think HIMYM will be a suitable show for you. Similar to friends and the other sitcoms, HIMYM's story is based upon the day to day life activities of a group of friends. The characters were build deeply in accordance with the story line. Everything about this sitcom is exiting. In my opinion ever sitcom lovers should give it a try.\n",

I don't know how to get this review to 600 characters without giving you to much info about the show, but every main character is lovable in their own unique way. That being said the show will take you on a Rollercoaster of emotions. You'll read this review and you won't believe this show is truly the best, but trust me it is, The Office has nothing on this show and it never will. In fact if you were trapped on a deserted island and had to pick in between the two pick How I Met Your Mother every time!!\n",

      "A huge waste of time! Make yourself a favor and don't watch it.\n",
      "0 \t\t My hate object no 1 when it comes to sitcoms. The jokes are the standard relationship nonsense we have all seen a million times before, the characters feel soulless and boring and pretty much all episodes have an absolutely completely uninteresting story. I just cant imagine how this show made it as big as it did as we have seen it all before but never quite this bad. Biggest problem is however the character Barney who is a womanizing partydude that is completely non believable. Without any doubt the most uncharismatic character i have ever seen, yes EVER! The people behind this show should be executed for crimes against humanity and the mastertapes should be buried in the mariana trench to prevent it from ever resurfacing.Stay away for gods sake...stay away!\n",
      "1 \t\t The show is Hilarious it's the kind of comedy Show where you could watch again and and still think it's funny If you are a fan of this show or This Genre highly recommend it My favorite character is Barney Stinson Still holds up today.\n",
      "0 \t\t I have seen a handful of episodes of this show, I have been told by many friends it's \"hysterical\" and \"really funny\" I watched it and my first presumption was this was a kids comedy show, I completely dumbfounded that people can watch this \"comedy\" I will give you a basic summary of why I think this.Incredibly non-sensical jokes that don't exist in the lines of satire, wit or slapstick, they're just self contained and have no substance - Most of the characters, story and settings are cookie cutter generic with nothing special to make them stand out - Over indulgent in musical montages that seem to go on far too long - Josh Radnors man child character is infuriatingly annoying - Overly sentimental \"messages\" and monologues that would make the sappiest of saps feel sick - Recycling the same story lines over and over again, this thing about meeting the mother gets teased all the time and most of the characters have broken up, got with other people and decided they \"love\" someone else, only to do the same thing again, i don't really think the writers grasp the concept on this \"love\" thing, it makes all the characters just come across as incredibly stupid and shallow and the fact every character has apparently decided to move away, every damn episode.Comedy has took a nose dive in recent years, the fact people find amusement in this programme greatly worries me, it is devoid of substance, personality, jokes that make sense (Flashback about turning a dog into a turtle was where I gave up all hope) and is all round a random, messy, hyperactive mess I wouldn't even let a kid watch, and if they had any brains they wouldn't want to.But if this easily digestible TV is what the masses want, it's what the masses get.3/10 - Bad!\n",
      "1 \t\t The first time I saw this show I loved it, I watched through the first and second season and loved, the thirds season is where the show started to crack, they were repeating the same jokes and were only focusing on the story, now we just finished the eighth season, the show no longer has anything that makes me laugh just the worlds most annoying and stupid story, this show has become such garbage, the creator managed to take an amazing show and screw it up, they revealed the mother in the last episode of season eight, and it was just a random person, there is nothing unique about Ted's (main character) love life, I used to like this show and now I hate it, I would highly recommend viewing the first four seasons and then stopping the show is no longer funny the story is beyond stupid, this show is pathetic\n",
      "0 \t\t Don't get me wrong, I do love sitcoms. I love Frasier, I love Friends, I love Cheers, I love Black Adder, I love Last of the Summer Wine(mostly) and I love Fawlty Towers. But I just can't get into How I Met your Mother. At first it was alright, there were some good ideas, some of the situations were at least fun. But as the show has progressed, in my personal opinion it is running out of ideas and it feels more dull and laboured by the minute. I do like the production values, and there is one good character Barney, wonderfully played by Neil Patrick Harris. The other characters I don't care for, in general I find them stupid and unlikeable, while the writing and jokes are forced and predictable now that the show lacks a good pace and freshness and some of the situations are not at all funny, more inane if anything. The acting also feels forced and over-compensated, as if the actors know their characters and writing are lacking and they're trying to make it work. Harris in my opinion is the one exception who doesn't suffer, that's because he's that good an actor, he has had some bad material but he always gives his all to elevate it. All in all, I do like sitcoms and comedies when they're good, but How I Met Your Mother is an example of one I can't get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox\n",
      "1 \t\t Excellent series to waste some time. Perfect for the romantic souls! The story is about five friends and their love adventures, mixed up with tons of funny stories. Ted is a lonely guy, who wants to make a family, but the girl he loves does not want a serious relationship and keeps cutting off his attempts to win her heart. Marshal and Lilly are Ted's best friends they are together for 9 years and are planning a wedding with all the consequences coming from that. Barny is the Casanova of the company. He's funny and arrogant in a very humouristic way. The director's method's are different and will keep your attention in these cute series.\n",
      "1 \t\t I have watched all the episodes of this show from the start and initially enjoyed it. Unlike some here, I appreciated the clever editing in some shows but slowly this has diminished. Currently the show seems intent on dragging out the sage of \"HIMYM\" and it really needs to get to that actual story. I understand that the need to weave the time-lines together is a good writing trick, but sadly we don't appear to be getting anywhere nearer. Ted is looking for his soul mate and we know that the woman under the Yellow Umbrella (who we haven't seen the face of) is supposed to be her (but we wait for 'another' twist) which will mean it isn't!This series (8) more than any, I have felt that the writers are doing their best to work out how to get to 10-series. Still we have the Ted and Robin ongoing saga, Marshall and Lily have become virtually insignificant and Barney just doesn't seem to be doing anything. I felt that this series (so-far to episode 5) nothing has actually happened.Whether the writers are tired or the actors have no motivation, I just don't know, but currently all the spark and 'fun' seem to have sadly withered away.Personally speaking, we need Ted to meet their mother and then see how they got to the wedding and births a damn site quicker than we currently are. Interest is fading fast and soon it'll be called \"Who cares how I met your mother\".(BTW I think the mother is the woman that Ted bumped into in the nightclub very briefly, but for no script progress purpose (so-far!))\n",
      "0 \t\t I had heard from several people that this show was \"amazing,\" \"funny,\" and any number of other wonderful adjectives. So, why had I never heard of it? It has been running since 2005 after all, and this is 7 years later. Well, Netflix supplied the answer with 5 episodes of the most recycled, predictable garbage I have ever seen on television. I didn't laugh a single time, accurately predicting almost every encounter in the first few seconds and staring at the screen in baffled wonderment. How is this show popular?! This show is essentially THE prime example of our American pursuit of laziness. We don't dare watch a show that challenges our thinking or is interesting in any way, we just want to watch the same crap that has been on TV since the first fart joke debuted.I digress... This show was trashy, boring, insulting to the intelligence of a kindergartner, and poorly executed at that. In short, an epic piece of utter trash that I will avoid at all costs in the future. Others are of course entitled to their opinions, but for those unsure if they'd like to take a chance on it, don't! I would sincerely rather watch an infomercial; it would be funnier.\n",
      "0 \t\t Yikes this show is bad. It is a true testament to how far our society has fallen when How I Met Your Mother, 2 1/2 Men, and 2 broke girls are considered funny. The laugh track sitcom died when Seinfeld, everybody loves Raymond, and king of queens left television. Now all writing revolves around childish sexual innuendos. It caters to today's retarded generation of teenage boys and girls; that is the same group who believe that Dane Cook is hysterical. Sitcoms belong to the funny stand up comedian, not Neil Patrick Harris, Ashton Kutcher, and that ugly girl from the 40 year old virgin. Other genres of comedy have been taking over. Parks and Recreation is the funniest show on TV by far. Those comedies are alive and well; however, the laugh track sitcom is dead.\n",

      "1 \t\t My mom told me a story of how she met my dad when I was seven. It lasted for about twenty minutes and it was a sweet story I still remember and cherish. You probably know where I'm going with this but ... Let me just get this off of my chest: Stop watching this show after you finish 4th season ... just ... stop, for your own good. HIMYM was once an amazing comedy. Sure, it wasn't as great as Seinfield or Friends, but it had its charms. Sure, the characters were barely interesting but it had some great moments. I'd laugh few times every episode and it was enough. I didn't really want anything else from this show. So, why the hell would they take that away from me? I can spout out for ten thousand words (for each season), but why would I do that? This show turned into everything else but comedy. Heck, even I can come up with better jokes about LeBron and Canadians. No! Just stop it! It doesn't take nine years to tell a story about how you met some woman! It took three minutes to tell them how you met Robin. Why does it take 9 years then to tell how you met this other girl? The show dragged out far beyond its limits. It broke itself apart after the 4th season ended. After that, each season was just worse and worse. The jokes became blunt, not even remotely funny. Awkward moments are rushed, sweet moments are empty and each episode just leaves me wanting this show to end. If the writers were going for this, great, they did it. This show has fallen into the abysmal pit and I really doubt they'll get out of it - not even if they ever show who the hell their mom is anyway. HIMYM was once a decent, at times even great show. However, it overstayed its welcome. Now it's just \"... another TV show ... darn ...\", and it somewhat breaks my heart because this show really had some potential.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show started not to long after Friends ended but I thought i was a perfect re-placement for Friends. I not lot fan don't like me Comparing both shows, both are set in new york and their daily love lives. I loved first 3 season, I thought every episode had in laughing and loud for 30 mins each week! Those series really well done as pace was really good in those series and there not many filler episode (This current season) After season 3, I think that when really start to lose it's charm , it did have some good decent and now again, I which really enjoyed. The next few season were a really mixed bag and this latest series is to me as been really bad, I have worst series yet, I don't think there was on decent episode I liked this year! I hoping this is the last season but those Kids on those couch have their own kids! 6 out of 10\n",
      "0 \t\t This really is the most awful show. Clichéd writing and amateurish performances makes this a decidedly disappointing viewing experience. Time to bring it all to an end and move on to something watchable.The situations are poor and the execution of them is laboured. It is almost as though a team of writers have come together to think up the most obvious, in your face, situations and have then proceeded script them. One of the disadvantages of teams of scriptwriters on a show is that the ideas pass through a committee stage and most of the good ones don't get through.If it were not for the US The Office I would award this the worst comedy ever.\n",
      "0 \t\t When I started watching this series, it's great. But only the first season. The series are all based on stereotypes, which only superficially seem funny, but when you use it 0.01% of the brain understand the point that's not funny at all.In the second season appears Robin's sister, who tells everyone how will she lose her virginity, like to talk about her shoes, in front of hundreds of people in the lobby, plus friends and it should be funny or interesting...Nope, it's not. It's sad and somewhat pathetic. Also, in some episodes it appears that Marshall, Ted or even Barney cry for absolutely nothing (just to make the scene look superficially funny). Pathetic, again. Marshal and Lily are utterly boring couple (and I am talking just about first 2 seasons, but guess how they will look later).When you really think about the meaning of the dialogs at the beginning of the first season (and later) where Ted is trying to find a woman of his dreams, you will realize how everything is pathetic and sad. I think those are the right words for this show: Pathetic show.I do not know who the target audience of this series, but the writers seem to think that the audience never thinks deeper than the superficial. I just can not give more than 2/10, as much as I tried to pull out the more positive of this show.Addition: I just watched episode 14 (Season 2), and my mouth was almost open, but not for laughs but of astonishment. Is it possible that someone wrote this? Scene: \"Friends\" want to watch super bowl, but some guy died and it turns out that they need to go to his funeral and now they make a \"funny moments\" because they don't know him. Then all look in his coffin to see his face, and all said \"oooh\" (means: \"now we remember who he is\"). *background laughter*. A man was noticed their reaction, so then again, they say \"oooh\" (like they are all sad). *background laughter*. Super bowl is over and they want to watch the game but all agreed that no one knows the result in the meantime. And then follows \"the funny moments\" where they act as they were out from mental hospital. Seriously, who wrote this episode?Objectively, there are some funny moments, but there is so much nonsense that it is hard to describe, as it is a series made ​​for retarded amoeba that respond to background laughter. How did this series get nine seasons? \"How I watched pathetic show\".\n",
      "1 \t\t It pains me to say this, but HIMYM is no longer good. It jumped the shark season 5, episode 11 with Last Cigarette Ever. There was minor dolphin vaulting earlier on, but this is the waterskis/jaws jump. S05e11 episode proved that the show is going on longer than expected. The first season is great. The premise is excellent and the 'everything happens for a reason' theme can't help but make you feel warm and fuzzy. Then something awful happened. Viewers started liking Barney more than Ted. Jason Segel became a hit with Forgetting Sarah Marshall (even though Slackers should have done that for him) and Alyson Hannigan won a People's Choice Award. This should all be seen as good news for a great show, but it isn't. The writers decided to feature these characters more and more. The show is no longer about how i met your mother, but about how many chicks Barney banged, how strong Marshall and Lily's love is, and oh ya, Ted sometimes. The majority of episodes now are filler. There SHOULD be nothing wrong with that, it adds character development, but obvious filler is embarrassing. Trying to extend something beyond it's life is pathetic. This show is like a twenty year old dog on a respirator. Either get on with the story or put it to sleep.\n",
      "0 \t\t When I first started watching How I met your mother I felt it had the potential to be a new Friends. It was funny, the characters were lovable, interesting, and had personality. The story was quite engaging and this is how it went for 3 seasons. Then the show got stuck. The main plot just goes in circles and all side plots, which could have been really interesting on their own, just get lost among fillers and boring moments that make you wish you'd stop watching the show. That's what I eventually did around season 7, and I only regret not have taking that decision earlier. I did feel tempted to go back to it for the last season, but I decided not to. From what I learned afterwards about the ending of the whole show and how the plot developed, I definitely don't regret my decision. The only thing I regret was season 5 and 6. Wish I had stopped back in the 4th, when I realised the show was going nowhere or even better at the end of season 3 (peak of the show).\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the funniest show I've seen till now, however the ending while isolated makes sense, taking in consideration how the season developed was bad and cheap. The ending would fit perfectly after the third season.\n",
      "0 \t\t The series is one series where the writers crap all over the audience. They build the characters and make us love them over a period of over 70 hours, they make us guess over what is going to happen and so on and in the last 10 minutes they crap all over everything. The only persons that will enjoy the show's ending are women that still believe that they have time to find a man after they build a career. Ladies, once you hit the wall (around 30) no one will want you. That guy that kept trying to be with you will be gone. He would rather be single than with you. While every character does some reprehensible things that could cause one to hate them the only character that you can really hate is Robin. While in the beginning she can be seen as a normal woman around season 3-4 she turns into a version of Samantha from Sex and the City. She becomes a narcissistic egotistical person so obsessed on what she wants that she cannot accept other people as having wants and needs. This is the type of person that deserve to die alone because her character pushes everyone away and she does not want to change, yet is the only character that truly gets a happy ending. It is middle finger from the writers to us. The rest of the show in my opinion deserves at least a 9, but those last 10 minutes are just a FU to us.\n",
      "1 \t\t Though the ending may seem to be rushed, It is actually a very realistic ending, or else why would ted tell the story when he met robin since the story is all about how he met his wife, so if the ending is different and ted and tracy lived happily ever after, then 80% of the story is a waste. The jokes in this show is still understandable to teenage like me so I highly recommend for people aged 16 above to watch this\n",
      "1 \t\t This is probably my 3rd fav sitcom after friends and bbt. The story may not be the best, but ya sitcoms are not actually for their storylines. But its cinematography is the best of all sitcoms. I dont know if i have used the right term but i meant how each ep is presented. Each ep has like a twist in it, not in the story but how the story is presented. So hats off to the directors and the editors. And ya without barney i think the show would lose its charm, so that is a little drawback.\n",
      "1 \t\t Disappointed in the negative reviews.. not in the show. The show is amazing. I don't have enough words to describe how this show becomes my favorite\n",
      "0 \t\t A comedy about a guy who loves sex, love and scoring hanging around with people who are more straight forward.. how original...Money + Sex = 99% population satisfaction. Terrible series, not funny. They should only be playing the laughing track to how bad this is.\n",
      "0 \t\t i have come to the conclusion that there is no mother she doesn't exist no one would ever want to be with ted mosby the kids that he talks to throughout the show aren't even his there just some random kids he probably kidnapped and is forcing to listen to him ramble about chicks he use to stalk. honestly i use to be a huge fan of the show but it really went downhill due to the constant false hope of actually seeing this \"mother\" this TV show has been on far over its lifespan the actors that play the freakin kids are adults now which should tell the producer's that maybe its time to just say who the mom is and end the show?\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of the longest and sweetest love story. Friendship, comedy, love... Everything was there in perfect proportion.. The story never missed a beat.. the actors never disappointed.. in all it was a perfect series to have fun with.. Thanks to the entire team..\n",
      "0 \t\t Long and draining. Boring and not-funny. Why would you watch copy of something, when you can watch the original. Sometimes you can and sometimes you can't, and this one you probably shoudn't. You will miss nothing and gain some time (hours and hours of time you can spend watching something better).\n",
      "0 \t\t Yes, this is a hard thing to say for me about a show that I really enjoyed watching over the years, but I simply can not enjoy re-watching any of its episodes (and there are plenty of great ones), because at the beginning of an episode where Ted explains how this story/ episode is in context with him meeting the mother, you know you are being cheated.It's like you wanna shout at the screen: \"not Ted, this is not the story how you met the mother...this is the story how you wanna bang Robin again after your wife is already dead!\".They could have even killed the mother off and it still would have been enjoyable to re-watch the whole series, even with a extremely sad ending.But clearly explaining (in a horrible scene with the kids) that the story was never about the mother, but a desperate attempt by Ted to get his kid's approval to screw Robin again (for the hundredth time) over the dead body of his wife ruins it forever, sorry. Especially that one scene with the kids was like a giant slap in the face for the audience in my opinion.It's not that this ending, as many have pointed out, may not be realistic in real life (it definitely is realistic). But that's not the point, the point is flushing down the toilet the whole premise of the show in the last 20 minutes, just because you can't let go of your own \"lovechild\" (which is the \"clever\" ending they already shot is Season 2). Needless to say this ending wouldn't have even worked in Season 3 or 4, but it for sure didn't work after 9 Seasons.Unless you shipped Robin and Ted hard, and always thought the whole show was only about the two of them, re-watching it is just painful and meaningless.\n",
      "0 \t\t If you want to watch a show that starts out strong and then falls apart this is the show for you, the acting goes from good to mediocre to outright ridiculous. The plot lines could have been written by a 10 year old but they were all in school or at home watching shows that weren't this awful. This is the kind of show that after 9 seasons makes you wonder if you could sue a company for wasting your life. If they had canceled this show after season 4 it would have been the best decision they ever made, no not these guys, they made this epic failure drag on for another 5 seasons at which point they decided it was time to unleash the worst ending of all time. This show should have been called How to cry forever, because essentially that's how it ended. Ted should have just gotten a sex change and gotten it all over with. He's clearly more of a woman then any of the actual women in the show. 2/10 because the first 4 seasons didn't make you pass out from cliché boredom.\n",
      "0 \t\t Watched this show for awhile simply because it came on immediately after another show I liked. I got through about 5 seasons of it when finally I realized I almost NEVER laughed at this so called comedy and didn't really like anything about it and WHAT THE HELL am I doing with my time?!\n",
      "So many things wrong with this show:\n",
      "1. Who tells their kids about all the women he hooked up with prior to meeting his mother?\n",
      "2. Ted Mosbey is an unlikeable idiot and I could care less if he meets somebody.\n",
      "3. Marshall and Lily are a super annoying couple.\n",
      "4. Robin is pretty and forgettable - I seriously can't remember anything about her.\n",
      "5. Barney is clearly the best character, but even his schtick gets old after awhile.\n",
      "6. The laugh tracks (which to me are a clear indicator a show is not inherently funny in itself) are SUPER annoying and distracting and often used in spots of the show that are non-humorous situations.Overall, unfunny show about unlikeable people with laughter looped in the background...how does a show like this last NINE seasons?\n",
      "0 \t\t Everybody I know love this show. All of them say how funny it is, some try to live by the Stinson-code and everyone wants to participate in the \"International Suit-up Day\"...but not me.I've tried time after time to see the show, and well, I don't like it. yes I can see that the show is trying to be different than other shows, e.g. showing a date in the present and from 9 years ago at the same time or if/if not Marshall was robbed by a monkey or not. Even though its well made, and actually different from other shows, I cannot find this funny. The biggest problem is how its being told. If they didn't have the narrator voice in every episode I could watch more of it. Its irritating to hear a voice telling everything about the show, and do NOT let you think on your own.....oh yeah the Monkey episode tried to, but it was so obvious it would do that (the whole is it real or not?), that it ended more confusing than funny.Even though I'm the person who could love the show, I'm almost finished with my studies and is about to go to the \"real world\" and can see my self in Ted.....But it doesn't hit me. The date episode made me irritated at Ted and didn't made me laugh. the only thing I thought was \"why do you go on a 9 year old date that went bad, and didn't try your luck this time doing SOMETHING ELSE than actually recreating a bad date? how stupid are you?!\" it seemed unrealistic that two persons would actually recreate something like that, and NOT think \"hey he/she IS actually cool and nice, why not try something?\" It remind me a lot of the British show \"Coupling\", but that show is 1000 times more funny and genius well made than this show. They try the same things, have some of the same characters, but its just not that funny. The thing I like about the show, is actually how its made. its well made, interesting in showing time in different ways (present/past/future) and the whole reality (again with the monkey). The problem is, as I said, its going to fast and the narrator ruins a lot and some of the jokes are to obvious.(Ill still try to see the show, if so many of my friends like this show, maybe ill just need to check it out some more times.)\n",
      "0 \t\t This is the worst show I have ever had to sit through. I did not know what it was about, it was on at my house so I gave it a chance. This show is nothing but ENDLESS and I mean endless sex jokes. Which doesn't offend me in any way, I would just be rather having sex than watching a show where every single episode is nonstop sex talk. I do not even understand the humor in it, perhaps this show is for single people who are needy and alone so they enjoy all the sex jokes and talk about hooking up and endless scene after scene of guys hitting on girls. Realize this show is fiction and that you are wasting your time watching actors pretend to flirt with each other for eight straight seasons, it makes me sick.If you absolutely have to arouse yourself with sexual entertainment watch porn. I find it quite pathetic that anyone in a relationship would be entertained by this show about five characters who in hundreds of episodes talk about nothing but sex. Seriously if this entertains you then go make love to your wife or husband and stop watching this garbage.I tried to give it another chance and the episode that played was about one character having sex with enough girls to fill a bingo scorecard....what the hell is the appeal of watching this exactly?? For teenagers or single people.\n",
      "0 \t\t Others have weighed in on this very popular show by the thousands. I'm coming to this through my wife's Netflix binge watching. And for the record I know how it ends, haven't seen it, don't care. So many people complained about that but what they don't get is that it doesn't matter. Everyone knows how it ends after S1E3. Or they should. It's a freakin sitcom. It's going to be 100% predictable. Not bad predictable just predictable. For the first 4 or 5 seasons it's OK. After that though it's just annoying predictable. They're people in their late 20s early 30s who act like 18 and again that's fine until it gets super super old. How many years can you string along a shaggy dog story about whiny dysfunctional narcissists? 6 years? 7? 8? Nope. 9 long long long seasons of the same old old old same old. And by the way Ted Mosby should have been killed in an industrial accident early on. They could call it How I Killed That A-hole Ted Mosby. Anyway the shoe's been off the air for years, everyone's had their say and no one cares.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of the greatest mysteries of this universe is How this show got sooo popular. People who love this show act as if F.R.I.E.N.D.S never existed. This show is a terrible rip-off of 'FRIENDS' and I am insulting FRIENDS by comparing HIMYM with it. I mean c'mon.... the jokes are predictable and lame, the situations are kiddish, the characters live in a world of their own,the story NEVER seems to move on, they give stupid names to each and everything, the way 7-year olds do... (eg. Lets pull out the 'mosby', I've won the 'three way belt' etc. etc.) I've watched each and every episode of the show till date and have not laughed even once, smiled maybe but never laughed... whereas in shows like there Big Bang Theory, Friends, Seinfeld... I fall off my chair laughing at least once even if it is the nth time i am watching the episode....The only good thing about the show is Barney aka Neil Patrick Harris, probably the only reason I did watch every episode... otherwise the show is totally LAME....I give it 1/10 only because of him.\n",
      "0 \t\t Predictable sitcom garbage loaded with catchphrase-spewing one dimensional characters. Two stars because at least it's better than According to Jim, and I like the cast in this (other than Ted) - they just have very little to work with.\n",
      "1 \t\t Though many things match about FRIENDS and HIMYM but both are winners on their part. FRIENDS is obviously a classic however HIMYM was awesome too, if only the ending wasn't not screwed up, it would have been close to 9 in IMDB for sure.\n",
      "1 \t\t I would've given this show a 10/10 if it wasn't for the ending. I'll never get that bad taste out of my mouth. This could've been such a heartfelt ending about finding true love but no... the writers just wanted a plot twist. I hated it. Literally every other episode than the final is amazing though.\n",
      "1 \t\t My absolute favorite sitcom! I know this series inside and out and nevertheless I discover new little things that I have never noticed before. It has so many details and (almost) everything makes sense and is well thought out from beginning to end. Unfortunately, there are little things that are not thought out and illogical, but that's not bad because otherwise the series is really the hammer. Just the fact that the seasons build on each other and you know that everything is working towards something is just unique and makes special fun. The ending also makes so much sense! I don't want to spoil, but EVERYTHING makes sense in the end!We use so many phrases from HIMYM in our everyday lives and when you watch movies you haven't watched before, you often recognize scenes that were imitated or made fun of in HIMYM. The humor is also exactly what we love. I'm still laughing my ass off at the jokes the 100th time I watch it. You feel so close to the characters and know them inside out.\n",
      "0 \t\t How I Met Your Mother used to be a show which was extremely comfortable to watch, but as it progressed, it got very boring, and extremely draggy with Barney and Robin's relationship, and Lily's thoughts towards motherhood.In season 1-2, Lily had problems with getting married as she never got the chance to follow her dreams. Soon, she finally got over this. But, I hated how she suddenly brought this up in season 8 again, stating that she was only a 'mother'This is only one of the ways the creators of HIMYM love to rehash.Barney and Robin's relationship was very annoying. Millions of times, they loved each other, then did not, then did, then did not, then did. It's as if they can't make up their minds or something. The part about the two of them just went on and on and on, and the story slowly went from 'How I Met Your Mother' to 'Barney and Robin's Love Life'.Thank God that part ended as they finally got married.I can't believe they brought Victoria back. Just another way to drag, we all know that he is not going to end up with her anyway, but the writers obviously put that in to fill in some holes. The writers are beginning to lose ideas.I think that one of the biggest problems with the show is that it lost it's feel after season 6 when it wasn't as light-hearted and they started using the same jokes as before. I used to be at ease when I watched it, but now I even lose interest halfway through the episode. The later seasons (7,8) are still watchable, but are only worth a one- watch.\n",
      "0 \t\t I loved the beginning of the show, it was fun, sophisticated, realistic and anyone could relate to it. However, something happened and it gradually stopped making any sense. The jokes were not that funny anymore, the characters absurd and the plot weird. I was looking forward to the last season to finally finish the story, but the ending was nothing but a disappointment. All those seasons for the mother to just die in the end and such a big deal about Robin and Barney for them to just divorce and go back to the place they were in the very first season?! I suspect that the authors just didn't know what to do with the characters and just wanted to end the show anyhow. Last season honestly killed it all for me and my friends. Great disappointment.\n",
      "0 \t\t The Father:Kids I'm really sorry that I've been dragging out this brutal show.I know it's not funny and that the recorded laughter is set on overdrive.But the reason why I've been telling ye about all these messed up relationships that I have had in the past is........well......Ye know the way there's been a guy outside the door wearing a navy uniform during this whole talk? The Kids:Yes dad! The Father:Well kids he's a police officer that's escorted me here from prison because I'm a convicted serial rapist and ye both have different Mothers.The reason you never heard about them is they're pretty messed up due to what I did to them.You see kids this is actually a foster home and my case is coming up before the parole board pretty soon for revision.Sooooo is there any chance ye could back me up?Ie=This show BETTER have some mad,crazy,controversial ending after being dragged out for so long with the same story line,bad-tacky style acting and brutal-mind numbing attempts at humor!\n",
      "1 \t\t The show is based on a very good idea: a father is telling his children how he met their mother.But this is also a pretext to speak about the relationships between five persons (at the end comes the sixth person, the mother) in New York: their moments of joy, happiness, their pains and their hopes.\n",
      "Another excellent idea was to include the character of Robin Scherbatsky, a young Canadian woman and there are very swet and funny scenes when the friends discover the life of Robin in Canada or when they visit a Canadian bar in New York.\n",
      "1 \t\t Ive watched a lot of shows in my life, but this is easily the best one ive ever seen. This show combines aspects of real life with some classic aspects of sitcoms extremely well. The character development is amazing, and the plot is great as well. This show, in my opinion, is basically a sitcom on steroids. It's hilarious, has a great story, has a ton of romance, has a good bit of drama, has dynamic characters, has a lot of running gags/inside jokes, and is unique. The Pilot episode is one of the best Pilots ever and in itself is enough to get any sitcom lover addicted. The finale of HIMYM may not be perfect and is widely disliked, but it's not bad enough to discredit 200+ episodes of some of the best TV youll ever see. In my opinion, the finale isnt even bad, its just slightly flawed. I highly recommend watching this show all the way through. Just beware: you will become emotionally attached to each and every character because they're all likable and great.\n",
      "0 \t\t Let me first start off by saying that I realize many people compare this to Friends, and I was not a huge fan of that show, but at least I respected the writing and the acting. How I met your Mother is a bad version of that show. After watching most comedies on Netflix, I tried giving this show a chance and watched about 20 episodes.Here is my problem with this show. It really isn't funny but tries to force the humor on the viewer with it's live audience that seems to laugh at everything. NPH and Segal do a good job, and Lily and Robin try, but they can't act and I get annoyed by when I realize the jokes they are saying aren't funny, it's just the way they deliver it.The worst part is Ted though. Dull, not funny, and get's that stupid deer in head lights look all the time. He is by far the worst actor and it sucks that this show is based around him. This loser should lock down any of these girls he dates, but he never does. I stopped watching the show, but there isn't any good reason why All in all, I know this show is about relationships, but the writing is so choppy that I can't develop any real emotions for any of these characters. Oh yeah, and did I say, the show really isn't funny\n",
      "1 \t\t I feel the finale is going to be a disaster based on how its going so far. Ending nine years of a show that builds around how he meets the mother then telling us they only had a short time together and she died is just miserable and lazy writing. First its not creative and secondly is this a drama or a comedy? I think many viewers will feel stabbed in the back like they did with Lost's Finale and feel disappointed for watching the show all these years. If I personally had known this is what was going to happen I wouldn't have even started watching it. I hope the writers come up with something funny and shocking at the same time and give this show the great finale it deserves to put it on the map as a classic like Friends for future generations. Otherwise people will remember this show with utter resentment and no one will be interested in watching it in the future. Story about a guy on how he met his dead wife, ... lame. Keep it light and intelligent guys, not much of this season has been so hopefully the finale will make up for it.\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't have much in the way of a review other than to say that based on the pilot, I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun. It might not be the most original idea for the show (think Wonder Years) but it has it's own little twist that should make for some interesting episodes. Hopefully next weeks episode will be just as watchable and entertaining. If you haven't checked it out, I recommend that you do. Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris are the perfect complements to the show. The rest of the cast is somewhat unfamiliar to me though I must admit. I recall seeing Jason Segel in Freaks and Geeks, but I haven't really seen him in anything as impressive since so hopefully he'll bring the same originality he showed as Nick to his new character, Marshall. Josh Radnor is the newcomer in the bunch and he is just perfect for the part. He's cute yet dorky, with a lovable charm that will certainly endear him to many female viewers. I see only good things on the horizon for this show and I hope it finds a permanent home at CBS.\n",
      "1 \t\t The show is decent. That's pretty much it.\n",
      "At first it is fun, but it gets less and less fun as time goes by. And in the very end it is disappointing. First thing that comes to mind when i try to compare it to something are \"Friends\" without Joey and Chandler.\n",
      "1 \t\t The perfect amount of drama and comedy.\n",
      "Every character is perfectly developed and very rarely go outside of their core personality. I have seen every single episode and can say that our of 208 of them I might not have liked maybe 8. All the other episodes are captivating, unexpected, funny, accurate, realistic, full of positivity, and after you've seen all of them in the end you'll be a little bit better as a person. At least that's what it did for me.\n",

      "This show enhances everything Friends have done. Scripts are original, funny and really well-thought, storyline is crazy and references are everywhere.Everything they did great throughout the series, they wasted it all on last chapter, what a shame.Killing.off Tracy like that? It just not makes any sense, they built the storyline, the meeting, the umbrella, everything for her to be rip off like that?She was perfect for ted, it'd have been a perfect ending if they grew older together, but whatever.\n",
      "1 \t\t The final season is an absolute joke. The final episode is a slap in the face.\n",
      "1 \t\t I previously reviewed this show in the middle of the 7th season giving it an 8/10 because despite it dragging and having far too many filler episodes, it was gaining forward momentum to a finale. But after hearing news of yet another season renewal, I had to come back to change my review.This show has hit its peak, steadily declined, and then suddenly lost all control and crashed into the wall of mediocre TV sitcom. When the creators lose interest in the main character, you know it leads to no good. Yes, Barney and his awesome catchphrases and clever ideas are a riot, but this is not his show, yet he has become the main character. Going back to season 6, this show has had him go through all these dramatic twists, turns, and changes in his adult life to lead him to being a better man. Good for him, but once again, this is not his show.Ted has become an average joe with only a few solid episodes per season. Other than that, he is the butt of every joke, far from the witty, intelligent architect that was introduced back at the start. Even older Ted is starting to lose steam. Having to hear \"we'll get to that later\" for what seems every episode now really makes me shake my head. It's a formula that has worn out its welcome.I loved this show and thought it was one of the most creative sitcoms brought to television in recent years, but I feel as though the people behind-the-scenes have abandoned what made this show so amazing in the first place, and have focused on that paycheck that comes with good ratings. The only reason this show has a 6 is because the first few seasons were so amazing.Season 1 & 2: 10/10 hands down with Seasons 3 & 4 being great viewings as well. But how can this show appeal to a new audience knowing it would take 9 seasons just to get to the what the title represents. The journey should have ended a few seasons ago.The creators and CBS represent Older Ted, while we, the audience, represent his kids--Dad, if we wanted to hear about Uncle Barney's entire life from childhood to adulthood, we'd ask him. Get to the point of your story, you're wasting our time.\n",
      "1 \t\t I was scrolling through Netflix and stumbled on this.... i remember so many people saying they loved it but still never watched it. I wish I would have seen it earlier! Its sooo funny and I absolutely love the story and how all the characters work together!\n",
      "0 \t\t \"How I met your mother\" started as a very promising series. I couldn't get enough of it; it was so pleasant and funny that watching an entire season was a three-day job. It seems to have borrowed many elements from \"Friends\", but with many original ideas. Neil Patrick Harris' performance is outstanding. He is the heart of the show and the only character who can keep it together by himself. However, after the 4th season the show went downhill for me. Barney was in a relationship, which made him less energetic on the show, Marshall's jokes became childish, and it was very obvious that the producers were trying to extend and delay the plot. Season 5 had few good episodes, and many that can be characterized as \"fillers\"(for example the episode called \"The Window\" seems to have been thought up on the spot just to fill the weekly 20 minutes). I am now at the 3rd episode of season 6, and I am totally disappointed. I liked none of these episodes, the jokes have gotten too old, and Barney Stinson is no longer enough to keep the show interesting. Now, I only continue watching the show out of curiosity for the ending, which is a shame considering how great the beginning was.\n",
      "0 \t\t And then came awkward characters, awful realtionships and THE worse ending to a series I've ever witnessed. It was messy, pointless and made me not want to even revisit the older more enjoyable episodes. Every episode when I see Ted's children just feels like a blantant lie following the finale.\n",
      "1 \t\t Don't compare it with Friends or any other sitcom because it's just not some people goofing around...but it's much much more. HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER is a story of Ted and his best friends and how they go through a journey of ups and downs throughout those years and find a perfect girl for Ted. The most important reason for watching this show is definitely Niel Patrick Harris AKA Barney Stinson who'll make you laugh like crazy and the way he transforms Every thing into a humour is just amazing. Once you'll start with it you'll feel like a part of their story and everyday adventures. Ted is a character you can relate to whether be in terms of women or work. Some of the scenes in every episode are so heartwarming that you'll definitely re-watch it again and again. I promise that you'll not regret it!\n",
      "1 \t\t I'm not a fan of old-fashioned, \"Multi-camera\" sitcoms. They had their place in the past, but over the 80's, 90's and 2000's, the networks became polluted with them, and none of them tried anything new, unique or daring. Literally every sitcom was identical to the others, and I lost interest really quickly.I found myself gravitating towards \"Single Camera\" sitcoms- the sitcoms that dare to use cinema-style camera-work, eschew the corny laugh-track, and actually try daring material. Shows like \"Scrubs\", \"Arrested Development\" and my favorite comedies of all time, \"30 Rock\" and \"Community.\"And as a result, I dismissed \"How I Met Your Mother\" when it first began airing, thinking it to be just another of the same bland, Multi-Camera sitcom rip-off's. And to an extent, it can be cliché at times. But it has something that almost no other Multi-Cam sitcom these days have- heart and a daring streak.The series stars Josh Radnor, Alyson Hannigan, Jason Segal, Cobie Smulders and Neil Patrick Harris as five friends living in New York City, dealing with life, love, employment and all other issues that 20 and 30-somethings must contend with.Radnor stars as Ted Mosby, a helpless romantic architect who is the more-or-less lead of the series. The framing device that sets the entire series in motion is an older Ted in the year 2030 telling his children the story of how he met their mother.Segal portrays Marshall Ericksen, Ted's best friend from college. A kind-hearted oaf, Marshall is a lovable goofball.Hannigan plays Lily, Marshall's girlfriend. Similar to Marshall, she is a bit of a goofball and is very lovable. She's also a bit of an artist and works as a Kindergarten teacher.Smulders plays Robin Scherbatsky, a news reporter who emigrated from Canada. Raised by a tough father who alienated her and treated her more like a boy than a girl, Robin is fiercely independent, and much of the early seasons centers on the \"Will they or won't they?\" tension between her and Ted. (Which I won't spoil)And finally Neil Patrick Harris plays Barney Stinson, a womanizing, suit-obsessed, laser-tag fan. He is arguably the mascot of the series. However, despite the sometimes misogynistic and troubling facade he creates, he's actually a well-rounder person and a good friend, and secretly desires true love, whether or not he will admit it.For what it is, the series has a lot going for it. The cast is unusually strong and very relatable. They are the heart of the show, supplying realistic performances. And all of them will melt your heart time and again. The story lines are also surprisingly poignant, and some really troubling issues people face, including death, infertility, loss, etc. are explored in a much deeper way than other sitcoms. It's also interesting to see how the characters change over time, and obtain redemption.There's also a daring streak with the show and a bit of an edge. The show's structure as a non-linear piece (each episode is essentially a flashback, and each season there are scenes peppered in that take place in the past or future) makes it interesting, and keeps you guessing quite a bit. There is also some surprisingly adult humor, which was an interesting change of pace. And the fact that the show is actually essentially a mystery (we allegedly won't know who the mother is until near the end, and it's going to end at Season 9) gives it an addictive nature.That being said, there are some big problems with it still.Many episodes are hard-to-swallow. And over time, Seasons are becoming weaker, and like many shows, after Season's 3 and 4, it lost a bit of the spark, with more flat episodes and unfunny jokes.And despite the edge of some aspects, the show is, unfortunately, still a sitcom and still falls back on sitcom clichés far too often, making it feel a little stale at times.But the show isn't destroyed by these shortcomings. The massive heart and the fantastic cast really pull through and turn what could have been just an average sitcom into a surprisingly good sitcom with a lot of great, heartfelt episodes.I'm giving \"How I Met Your Mother\" a very strong 8 out of 10. It's not the best comedy on TV, but it's up there, and I'd highly recommend it.\n",
      "0 \t\t Well, I didn't start watching this series at all until the 2011. How ironic that Neil Patrick Harris should be playing a jaded, womanizing, stud. I love the Lily and Marshall coupling, and their funny relationship quirks. Fittingly, a real Canadian playing the role of a Canadian expat in New York.Ironically, the only character I don't like is Ted Moseby. Almost every show, they tease the audience with \"almost\" revealing the identity of Moseby's wife. I can honestly say that I really don't care how he met their mother. We all know that they will never reveal the identity of the wife, even in the final episode. I can honestly say that I really don't care how he met their mother. Who are they trying to fool?! Sad to say, I no longer watch either re-runs or new episodes of this show mostly for that reason.\n",
      "1 \t\t Season 1 Episode 1 was really great. I really liked it and season 1 was also great. However it's getting lame after season 5. Irritating episodes. Always make fun with the lame jokes.. Didn't see the mother till season 8. Whole story is vogues just waste of time like Indian TV shows. I still have to mention that Season 05x12 episode was the best.However other than that whole show become a mess with continuous lame joke most of the time. Don't understand why people like it. I see only girls like it.Watching many episodes of this show, all I see is that characters constantly changing their beliefs, decisions, and actions back and forth without any logical reasons: we two must break up, no, we must get back together, no, that's just impulse, we should still break up, no, that's true love, we must get back together, no, it's true love because we wanted it to be, we should break up......\n",
      "1 \t\t Best show ever, my boyfriend insisted on watching this and I used to hate sitcoms... well until I watched this show! After a while this show became our comfort show and we gained a new perspective to life in each episode. Ted, Marshal, Barney, Robin and Lily are like the best friends I never had where I both love & hate them. I wish it never finished but I guess every good thing has an ending:) Anyways the people who are watching this show for the first time; I wish I were you. Love my boyfriend for forcing me to watch this show with him. Everyday for like a 20 minutes I forget all my problems and miseries. Thank you for this show and the creativity of the producers... and of course shoutout to my boyfriend, this show is one of the puzzle pieces in our relationship:))\n",
      "0 \t\t I have been the biggest fen of HIMYM in season 1 to 5, maybe 6....but now, while watching season 9 I wish I have never had come across this show.From the start, episodes were funny, unpredictable, joyful, and I couldn't wait to see the next episode..now (season 8/9) the jokes are just bad, there is actually NO plot...I always start to watch new episodes with hope that something interesting would happen - because of the effect of shows glory days...instead I usually fast forward the show or just don't watch it...because nothing happens...the same jokes over and over again, no plot, no new facts, no life,...i believe this is all because of the money and naive loyal fans who cant see that they (producers) are trying to get as much as they can from the show/audience.All the producers/directors should know when to end the show!! This show should have ended 3 seasons ago!! when it was good, so all the people would remember it by the intensity and humor...now...it is crap!!!!thank you\n",
      "0 \t\t This was always a sitcom I never paid much attention to, but picked up most of the storyline from intermittent episodes on whilst watching reruns on TV.The best part of show is Barney Stinson played by Neil Patrick Harris. On the side, the worst part of the show is Lily Aldrin as she is simply a horrible and deceitful character.I'm starting to watch the entire series in order from the beginning. Edit: Up to Season 5, and gradually improved my initial thoughts on the show.\n",
      "0 \t\t Often compared to friends which it shouldn't it's not funny it's just a cringe fest launched a few careers glad it's come to an end as channel 4 in the U.K. would put it on whenever they want to fill a gap in the lineup or fill up E4\n",
      "1 \t\t The show does have the odd good episode that makes you laugh. After watching friends its hard to fall in love with this one. I found it can be very childish at times and very un relatable. Even with two main woman leads, the show down grades woman as they treat them like garbage to be used and disposed of. It also feels like the characters are stuck in one place in time. There isn't much development in the characters life or change that happens. Mostly each episode is about picking up woman. The only nice thing about the show is when you run out of comedies to watch; this one does have some humor in it and the cast is enjoyable to watch.\n",
      "0 \t\t Those who made the ending should be ashamed, they don't get that sometimes you have to do the expected... I'm petty sure that the ending broke most of the viewers heart and unlike to what the creators said about the ending, this does'nt teach anything positive. It actually may relapse to any good possible relationship in the future.This ending made the mother unimportant although the whole show was about meeting her, it made Barney's feelings and commitments meaningless (if he loves Robing why divorce her??!) and the worst: it returns the characters to the beginning like nothing happened.Here is my advice to the viewers: you are looking for a good show? don't try the comedy ones!! check out the drama law enforcement ones: CSI, NCIS, Hawaii 5-0, Law & Order, Bones, Criminal Minds, Blue Bloods etc. If Carter Bays and Craig Thomas want to show the unexpected so much, they really should learn from creators like Robin Green & Mitchell Burgess how to do so.... (in the more fascinating way and positive side)\n",
      "1 \t\t I am extremely disappointed. I used to love this show when it first came out. And for the first 5 seasons I really did have a great time watching. I didn't necessarily laugh hysterically all the time, but it def. got a few laughs out of me. Everyone was in love with the characters, in love with the set up, in love with the story and the idea. I think the strongest selling point for this show was the name. \"How I met your mother\" was clever because it was new. It's kind of a weird title. a bit bizarre so people wanted to know more. Obviously after watching a few episodes you get the jest of it and you start to see how it's just future Ted Mosby talking to his kids narrating the supposed story of how he met their mother. Right, all good. Now we go through different ups and downs in Ted's life and we learn about the different characters which were constructed beautifully and I believe nailed by every single one of the actors. The problem lies with the show producers milking it to make more money. The story is pretty much done. Ted dated every kind of girl he possibly could. Almost got married god knows how many times. Once actually came close to it but got left at the altar. The show is simply not that funny anymore. It's starting to be pathetic really, as they desperately drag it much longer than it needs to. It's time to end it and move on.\n",
      "0 \t\t That ending was so bate and switch it made my head spin. How can you make an ending so bad that it ruins all rewatch ability. Thanks for that. Could have been a 10 but now it's a 1.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your Mother is a show of variable quality with episodes ranging from hilarious to poor. For example Slap Bet, Stuff, Third Wheel and I'm not that Guy are episodes that actually have me constantly laughing with the laugh track, instead of sometimes.Barney is the best character on the show. This is because he has actually been developing from sex-crazed nutcase to a more normal person with feelings, though he keeps them for the most part hidden. He is constantly funny with his laws, rules, bets and his perception of the world. Though every joke of his is a one-liner or built from a one-liner they are more hit than miss because of the strong delivery.To contrast Robin and Ted are weak characters. Ted, though the narrator and main character, is simply a frustrating character. He is constantly annoying and though that can sometimes be funny for the most part it is just annoying to the viewer. The other problem with Ted is that though he has supposedly changed throughout the four years of the show so he can become the man who met their mother he really has changed very little as a person, though in season 3 there was some good development it was quickly thrown away.Robin is just a character which really has very little grounding in reality. She has too many things which make her completely unrelatable to anybody. Though that is good for T.V. shows that position in this show is filled by Barney, who is simply a better rounded character and is also funny. Marshall and Lily are solid characters. They have both had good and bad moments and don't quite feel real or very interesting because of their stupid habits and cutesy relationship, though Marshall in particular is very funny with a mixture of one-liners and running gags.All in all the show is a good sitcom, able to make me laugh now and then through any episode but simply has a lack of subtle jokes and very little development which handicap it from being a great show.\n",
      "1 \t\t Best show I've ever seen. My favorite. Ive probably seen every season like 12 times. It's that good balance of comedy, romance, storytelling and captivating writing that you just can't beat.\n",
      "0 \t\t I enjoy the show when he's not on screen or talking, I find bits hilarious, I enjoy all the other characters bar none. Hate the narration voice being different to main character so drastically and the talking to kid thing started great but seemed ridiculous in series 5/6/7/8.For me either the writing or just the awful actor ruined ted, he tried to seem endearing with the most slapable face ever, treated girls like utter rubbish, was so emotionally immature at 25 the scenarios were ridiculous and behaved in ways any intelligent girls would hate him. He's not likeable,he's selfish and just is easily the worst main character in a sitcom ever. Everything about him from face to delivery to just presence I detested. Even rewatching I just hate him. The ending sucked to but for me this is a10/10 with a better lead guy.\n",
      "0 \t\t Another show that lasted longer than it should have the show is great, well written, with a plot well tied up until the 5th season which is when it starts to get tiring, the 6th season is still bearable the rest is not I always found the story and story development very good, the jokes often didn't make me laugh, but that wasn't a problem because the show was very interesting, it was a romantic comedy that escaped from certain boring stories and used a new way of acting. Tell an old story in an incredibly smart way the acting was good, Barney was the brilliance of the show, the cinematography is beautiful, the soundtrack is great just sinned for not finishing when it should.\n",
      "1 \t\t I watched this over 10 times and never tires me. Most funny and mature show on tv. Must watch.\n",
      "1 \t\t Giving 10 stars to anything is a big thing, it means you absolutely love this show, which i did. Yes i am giving this TV series a 10/10. And ill tell you why.How i met your mother means so many things to me, i can not say i was one of those people that watched the show when it first came out in 2005, but years down the road i started to watch it weekly. I'm glad i did. It really got me hooked on it. We all know the story. Ted is explaining to his kids How he met there mother. Its about him on his journey to find his true love. Yes sounds a bit cheesy but this show has got everything. Every character brings there own traits, we have Ted, Marshall, Lilly, Robin and Barney. These five characters are the ones who will bring so much laughter, happiness, sadness, joy you name it everything, its amazing. Its literally like going on an emotional roller-coaster. The story is simple but yet brings so much to the show. You can't help but love it.The comedy is perfect, i think everyone can laugh at it. Its all different sides of humor its well balanced, also best thing about it, it's used at appropriate times. Over time the show keeps its comedy but then becomes a little bit more emotional. I really did enjoy it. Now this show has come to end. And i suggest who have not seen it or just watched episodes there and then. Please you will not regret it, watch this show. I have no doubt you will love it.So i guess this is my review but also my good bye to this show. How I Met Your Mother thank you so much for everything, you bought joy, laughter, happiness, sadness and everything to me. I loved everything about it, specially all the characters, they have become inspirational beings in anyone's life. The story is compelling with so many life lessons. All i can say thank you so much How I Met Your Mother i will miss you. GoodBye Kids\n",
      "1 \t\t I really love the show it's really good and hilarious every episode I die laughing\n",
      "0 \t\t A re-imagining of Friends via Coupling but missing what made these work. Two attractive but dreary female leads who most of the time could just as easily not be there for all the use the scriptwriters make of them. Then there are the 3 male leads, Ted a moronic romantic who falls for every girl he meets is infatuated by them on Monday and has run away from them by Tuesday, Barney a deeply unpleasant misogynist who treats his friends and the various women he beds with utter disdain (are women really that stupid), and then there is Marshall a hulking child prone to tantrums and violence. Of course all the males have wonderful careers despite their various social inadequacies. The main problem outwith that is that after a decade the characters really have not grown or learnt anything. try The Big Bang Theory instead.\n",
      "1 \t\t The concept and mystery of how Ted met his soulmate was very alluring. This show likely gained its popularity due to how easy it is to relate to Ted. So many of us can put ourselves in his shoes and were excited to go on his journey with him. But boy was it a long one. HIMYM is clearly a product of its time, a network programme. Due to its appeal it became very commercial and it painfully dragged on for 9 seasons. There some gems here and there but its latter seasons were space fillers. HIMYM wouldn't have survived in the age of Netflix and streaming. Nowadays top shows keep it to 10 episodes among stiff competition. If HIMYM had to restrict its episodes and bring it forward it probably could be one of greatest shows ever made. But alas it definitely isn't. Despite its positives it gave a weak payoff and rushed its ending in poor fashion. Viewers like myself who committed to 9 seasons only got a few minutes of the Mother. The show also had too many unrealistic relationships and beat around the bush many times. If they reduced their episodes and focused on quality it could have resulted in a much better show and truly earned the right to be called Legend (wait for it) ary\n",
      "1 \t\t First, this show is really great.. I love the story, the cast, the chemistry, the jokes, the feels and so on.\n",
      "All of them crafted to make one of the best sitcom ever aired on TV!\n",
      "And as depicted in the titular title; \"How\", It's gonna be a journey that you'll never forget! Belive me.Not only enjoyable, but the show has something special to make it very memorable.. you can feel them and it's like you're there and know the characters so well.\n",
      "Kudos to the cast & writers!!Now, the ending....\n",
      "I know there will be so much controversies for that unexpected finale.\n",
      "But i dont even mind cause it's totally acceptable.\n",
      "Also the best thing is the writers make an alternate version to the ending, make this series perfect for everyone!I know most fans felt betrayed and dissapointed since the last three seasons misguide us to expect a \"happy ending\".\n",
      "But bear with me, if you think carefully and rewatch the show knowing the ending from its early days, it's make sense to make the ending that way..\n",
      "The point of the whole series is not about the title. There is a bigger story than \"How Ted met the mother of his children\". But it's the story about \"How Ted find his love with good friends around him\"So it makes the ending as the most rational thing and the closest possible closure to the stories. Yes it's kinda bitter and unfortunate, but you can see that as the ugly truth in their world that very close to the reality. Life isn't perfect and somehow love gonna find its wayFortunately, the writers themself mention in the interview that they were struggling to to decide which ending to be aired. So they make an alternate version of the ending since they have 2 possible ending to conclude the series.\n",
      "So that's perfect for me.\n",
      "The first ending is for anyone who carefully enough to see the hints in the entire seasons of the series, and can accept the real motive on Ted's love story\n",
      "The second ending is for casual viewers that enjoy the story throughout the series with a happy ending that is supposed to be.\n",
      "Im really glad about that, and i thought that the story is open ended depends on how the viewers (including the writers) want to see how it ends.\n",
      "\"Unlike GOT ending which is from nowhere expected by the fans, i mean who would thought about khalesi cheap death or jon snow to back being a nightwatch after what he's been through?\"\n",
      "It has all of 2 ending that everyone needs.\n",
      "Ted with The Mother and Ted with Robin.The only drawback in this series to make it 9/10, that the first ending is far rushed. There's so little information around the events heading for the ultimate conclusion. Such as The Divorce and how Ted mourns his lost spouse, also how Ted back to Robin. All of them happen too fast.\n",
      "Ideally shoulda been an specific episode or two, focused on those events to make the conclusion more acceptable by the fans.Afterall it is a really good series to follow, it tolds us something special about friendship and what it means to growing old together. There were lots of laughs and feels in this ride that i'll never forget. Thank You HIMYM\n",
      "0 \t\t When i first heard of this show i was like \"hmm, this could be interesting\" , but no, it sucks. I first saw it in my girlfriends house, and thought \"wow, this is actually pretty entertaining\" but then i began to think about the jokes, the characters... and the only thing that came into my mind was \"Friends\". \"OMG, this is a copy of friends!!!\" i thought, and i was right, it's the exact same thing, the jokes the scenario the characters attitude and their friendship, it's all there!! Now tell me, why would they make a reboot of the 90's show? Because it sells, so why watch it? Just to prove my point i made a list of things that we have seen in \"Friends\" and that are similar in \"How i met your mother\" :MacLaren's Pub / Central Perk.Monica & Chandler/Lily & MarshallRachel & Ross date / Robin & Ted dateRachel & Joey date / Robin&Barney dateJoey's a womanizer / Barney is a womanizer.Barney and Phoebe don't know who their dad is. Both have been lied by their mother/grandmother respectively.Ross & Ted both end up as professors.Emily didn't want Rachel to be around Ross / Stella with Robin..And the list goes on...So that's that, \"How i met you're mother\" is like a show made for kids, it has stupid/childish jokes, it has loving/clichéd characters, and it has a moral in the end of every episode, to give us that worm feeling that everything is going to be alright... Man this show is the basic form of a US comedy, it always has been this way, and it will stay this way until people realize that sh*t like this is boring, repetitive and simple has hell, kinda like pop music these days, but that's another story...\n",
      "1 \t\t My cousin recommend me this show. I really like this show until last episode Part One but after watching Last Episode Part Two I have to write this review. Part two really sucks I don't understand If Tedd with Robin at the end Why Tedd met the Children mother (Tracy)?. I want to give this show 8 star but due to its end I give 5 star.\n",
      "0 \t\t Well, how to put it? Tastes are subjective but I really cannot imagine how somebody can give this show a 10, or even a 6! Someone compared this to Friends... well, it could be if it had humor, something that Friend had in abundance and sorely lacks in this one.I just really cannot cope with the fact that so many worthy shows struggle to get renewed or are outright canceled (Firefly to name the first that comes to my mind) and such garbage is now at what, the 9th season? I do like the actors, I'm a big fan of Neal Patrick Harris and Jason Segel, I really am. But they're only able to raise this show from its abysmal depths of crappiness to a level of utter mediocrity.I'll go re-watch Friends or even Joey for some real laughs, or Community if I want something more recent, How I Met You Mother is not worth the time spent to write this.\n",
      "1 \t\t I watched this show a few times last year and found it amusing and likably acted. I wasn't a regular viewer, but enjoyed the episodes I watched. I have caught on during a rerun cycle this season and now have 8PM Monday set aside. A recent rerun entitled \"Slap Bet\" may have been the funniest 1/2 hour sitcom I have ever seen. Laugh out loud funny scenes, created by hysterical writing (not mean spirited sniping) and perfectly performed by all cast members. The \"pop\" video portion was even a pretty catchy tune!!That is the show's strong suit, the ensemble cast performs with ease and chemistry rivaling two great NBC shows that will remain nameless. The casting of TV icons like Neil Patrick Harris and Alyson Hannigan is inspired and the fellow cast members are totally up to speed. Cobie Smulders, who I had never seen before, is drop dead gorgeous (was that really her singing in the video!?), and may not even be the \"Mother\" in question. This show has years of fun to go.If you don't mind poking fun at our Canadian friends (\"the 80's didn't get to Canada until '93\"), catch the \"Slap Bet\" episode on CBS.com, and join the fun ride.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is my favorite show. I can't even begin to explain how wonderfully written this is. The writers are genius. I recommend this show to everyone\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is the story of Ted Mosby(Josh Radnor) who decides to go in search for the love of his life with the help of his friends Marshall Eriksen(Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky(Cobie Smulders), Barney Stinson(Neil Patrick Harris) & Lily Aldrin(Alyson Hannigan). After Marshall decides to propose to his college sweetheart Lily, Ted realizes that he wants to get married too. The story is basically narrated by an elder Ted in the year 2030 to his son & daughter. Ted mainly talks about the events, that led up to the first time he met their mother. Hence, the title. However, don't be misled by the title. How I Met Your Mother, is mainly about the lives of the five friends.First off, How I Met Your Mother wouldn't be half as funny if it weren't for the smooth talking, womanizing and legen, wait for it, dary LEGENDARY Barney Stinson! Neil Patrick Harris has done, in Barney's own words, an AWESOME job in his portrayal of Barney. Barney's the highlight of the show. I'm not saying the others aren't funny. It's just that if things get a little dull, you can count on Barney to light up the show with his histrionics, leaving the viewers laughing, till their sides ache! Barney is Ted's second best friend after Marshall and gives Ted advice like, don't get married till you're 30! The Bro Code, is just one of the things that makes Barney so hilarious! Ted, is a lover boy who really wants to settle down in life. Ted desires the perfect life. Perfect wife, perfect kids(one boy & one girl) & a happily ever after. Josh Radnor has done a bang up job in his portrayal of Ted. Marshall, is Ted's best friend & Lily's fiancé and eventually, husband. He always gives Ted advice, on how to please the different girls he dates throughout all the seasons. Jason Segel has done an outstanding job in his portrayal of Marshall. Robin, is a strong woman. She's not a dumb bimbo but, she's Canadian. The group make fun of her often because of this. She's one of Ted's good friends & his ex-girlfriend which sometimes makes things a bit awkward between them. Cobie Smulders has done a spectacular job in her portrayal of Robin. Lily, is Ted's close friend & Marshall's wife. Lily gives Ted valuable advice on how to impress women & she knows what women want & like. Alyson Hannigan has done an incredible job in her portrayal of Lily. This show, now 6 seasons done & 7th season underway is getting a tad bit monotonous. Ted should really meet the mother as soon as possible! Nevertheless, this show is worth half an hour of your time. A must watch!\n",
      "1 \t\t Legendary show with the legendary barney. Lily is the most annoying, selfish character by far but the others are very good. I've rewatched at least 10 times and love it.As many series do suffered from a poor ending and lost much of its charm towards the end when they were looking to create a nice moment when ted goes back to robin who he met at the begin. I didn't feel like this worked and just seemed like a massive backwards step.The show was about how ted is hopeless romantic holding out for the perfect woman, which he got, only for the final episode to be about how he always wanted robin?Seasons 1-5 amazing\n",
      "Seasons 6-7 good\n",
      "Seasons 8-9 not so good\n",
      "0 \t\t How i met your mother was a very an amazing show!!! Then i saw the ending and realized that i had never seen a worse piece of garbage then when i threw out rancid turkey meat in the garbage(its freaking slimy)...this entire show was leading up to a kick in the nuts and i cant imagine a lazier piece of garbage who would, in the last 2 minutes of the entire show, kill off the main characters wife and have him finally get the girl hes been p**** footing over for the past 9 seasons...F*** THIS SHOW AND F*** CARTER BAYS AND CRAIG THOMAS you gave me happiness and took it away and you're sick people you need therapy\n",
      "0 \t\t This show has a lot of moments that just give you secondhand embarrassment. There are several times when the show relies on racism or sexism to get cheap laughs, which might've been acceptable if it came out in the 90s (which it didn't). But it's also really clever, and the storyline is compelling (although it does get quite frustrating sometimes).\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother was the first sitcom I ever saw and let me tell you that I was very pleased with the comedy world I just found. Sure the laughing track is always strange and its legitimacy can be questioned, but with that aside this TV show got me instantaneously hooked.There are several aspects of it that make it great, and even after finishing it I find myself re-watching it from time to time, given how much of a good experience it is, How I Met Your Mother has several strengths that can be seen right from the start, the original story telling and concept, where we see the narrator telling his tail on the past tense and even there we are constantly seeing flash forward and flash back events placed and edited beautifully and I think this was what got viewers really interested to begin with.Of course after you are invested, you fall in love more easily with the characters, and in this case I fell for Lilly and Marshal's chemistry, Barney's ridiculous over the top player persona, Robin's charisma and of course Ted's story. Following the adventures and the relationship of these characters always made my day, it placed me in a good mood specially since a lot of the series is not only about love and friends but the ridiculous depictions that are of course far from real, that's where the comedy gold lies.Even though HIMYM has his dramatic a tear dropping moments, the ridiculous jokes and scenes a lot of them coming from Barney himself are amazing and they allow us to leave reality for a moment and just enjoy the experience.Fortunately I saw most of the show without any intervals of time, all the way to the 9th season which was the only one I had to wait weekly for the episodes, so even though there are a lot of critics about the quality of the show dropping I actually didn't feel it, I loved most season, on the 8th things get a little bit more serious and less ridiculous which made things a bit stranger, but even season 9th being completely different from the previous had its moments.And then we arrive at the infamous ending which for me can be classified as one of the worst finales for a TV show.... We are basically slapped in the face with brutal reality which goes completely out of tone for the entire show:\n",
      "Barney's end is bad, you would hope that his arc with be complete with a good message that even the most broken individual can find redemption and loveAlso, having a season dedicated to a wedding that ends in 15 minutes was also not a good plan, specially with all the build up made for Barney and Robin relationshipThe fact that the mother is dead was a let down since we met her, she is Ted's perfect match and they did the hardest thing, they lived up to the expectation coming up with Tracey as an amazing character just to kill her offI believe they were stubborn they had their mind fixed for this finale since the beginning and didn't want to change, even the greatest TV shows make big change decisions as they go, look at Breaking Bad creator who thought initially to kill of Jessie on the first season, and of course thought twice!The fact that we keep circling back to Robin and Ted ending up with her, actually makes the TV show messed up, makes Robin kind of the villain to always push Ted back and its sad that for all those years he couldn't let go of her.We can all agree its a terrible ending that will leave a mark, nonetheless all the legendary moments that were given to us to re-watch over the years, still make me love this TV show!\n",
      "1 \t\t Is it me or others think of it too that this show actually funny and you genuinely laughs at their joke? I love friends too but this show is better friends and actually makes audience laugh, in friends I can watch it with straight face and honestly some jokes aren't that funny and you don't get laugh out of it, it's funny because there's background audience laugh in it. This show is way more practical and funny. No offense to friends fans, I love friends too but I love HIMYM more even though they don't have the perfect ending.\n",
      "0 \t\t I remember the first time I watched HIMYM was in 2009 and I found the plot to be innovative, consistent and interesting and it was all this for at least 6/7 seasons which is when it starts to focus repetitive and boring the chemistry of the cast is AMAZING, I love this group the ataucoes are good, the writing is good, the plot is good and well constructed, the photography is beautiful unfortunately it suffers from the problem of lasting longer than usual, but even so I'll give it a 9 and the spinn off sucks!\n",
      "1 \t\t I normally don't like comedies very much... but this truly is an exeption. Most of the time the actors in comedies are overacting it, making it less realistic. This one is trying to keep that to a minimum and the problems/situations they encounter feels like it could be you and your friends could have. Normally i don't watch movies or series a second time, especially comedy. But now i am almost done with my second run, and it is still funny. You should watch this, because you don't want to miss out on Neil Patrick Harris his role, Barney. it's just legen...wait for it... DARY!(I really would like to see a spin off/Follow up on this one, with the kids as the center of attention with their everyday problems and the parents playing support roles while forgetting that they were young once.)\n",
      "0 \t\t A lot of contextless sex jokes, stereotypical characters, and typical speculation about the unspoken rules of dating and relationships. Almost nothing clever or unique at all. The inspiration and influence for the characters and jokes seems to come 80% from established fictional characters and situations from sitcoms and romantic comedy movies, with maybe 20% original use of inspiration from either reality or a creative imagination which generally consists of geek references. Alyson Hannigan basically reprises her role from American Pie. None of the blame can really go to the actors, other than their poor decision in wanting to be involved in this show after reading the script. There's really no way to rise above the dull, dumb writing. Whatever presumed quirky appeal this show could have had based on Alyson Hannigan and Doogie Howser's involvement is immediately shattered after their first couple of scenes. This show has marginally less edge than Still Standing and Almost Perfect, but still teeters on the precipice of being watchable or not, making it better than According To Jim or Two And A Half Men, but significantly less funny, original, and clever than some late 90s sitcoms it hearkens back to such as Two Guys A Girl And A Pizza Place or Dharma And Greg. The extent to which focus is placed on emotional investment in the characters makes this possibly the most chick flickeqsue sitcom ever. The voice-over narration is the best part. I guess some people really hate that device but it works for me. The bottom line is this is a heartwarming crowdpleasaing comedy as opposed to a funny comedy. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it just is what it is. Some people's idea of comedy is gags filtered through emotionally appealing characters and relatable situations, and for them this show will probably deliver. I don't even necessarily find the \"drama with gags\" sitcom style inherently unappealing, but the dramatic portions of this show are too generic to do anything with the formula. The drama seems to be there just to support the gags, the gags seem to be there just to support the drama, neither aspect being strong enough to provide any appealing basis for the show.\n",
      "1 \t\t Show started with great promising characters. It's all about Ted's battle for finding the right partner for him. Fron the beginning of the show Ted and Robin are not the best match. After every season you lose interest in Ted and Tracy's love story because the mother was introduced in last season so she didn't have any chance to grow over the time. Also last season's half of the episodes are focused on Barney and Robin's wedding which didn't last BTW and they killed the mother so Ted can be with Robin without having kids. It's like Tracy was instructed only for Ted to have kids. Awful ending. Nobody cares about Ted's happy ending at the end of the season. One of my favourite shows with awful ending. Say whatever you want but Ted and Robin are the worst match on the show. Barney and Robin are perfect.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show! Love those fast forwards and flash backs.... everything makes sense (except the finale) that's why I decided to believe that Robin & Barney stay married. Their character development threw out this show can't be ignored because of a decision made by writers during 1st season.\n",
      "Other than that- AMAZING SHOW.... an despite the finale- WORTH TO WATCH....again, again, and again\n",
      "1 \t\t How do you rate a show that is (almost) up there with your favorite sitcoms, but where the quality goes downhill drastically halfway its lifespan? Jerry Seinfeld said it best: Go out on a high note and always leave the audience wanting more. That is exactly how I feel after its ninth and final season. How I met your mother tries a different approach: Leave the audience feeling freed of the burden of watching any more shallow, boring episodes. I have deleted episodes 4x13 and on. Episode 12 of the fourth season was another great one, so by ending the show in imminent rewatchings after this episode leaves me with the same feeling as the final episode of Seinfeld.\n",
      "0 \t\t I loved every single episode until the ending. It was one of the most disappointing endings ever. It's called \"how I met your mother\" not \"how I met robin\"\n",
      "0 \t\t Okay sure. It's funny. Has the similar issues we can go through. Watching your friends get married. Jumping from relationships, work life ect. But S1 E14 is the one that broke the camels back. There are plenty of episodes that are funny and relatable. Unfortunately, there are some that are a complete waste of time and realistically, don't make any sense. The sound track is child ish. Good story line, but I'm afraid I just can't seem to commit and follow through. I can't believe they made 9 seasons of this. If you like to watch someone without thinking to hard about it, watch this. But I'm pretty picky with my shows. Brilliant acting, but the soundtrack and some corny scenes ruin it for me.\n",
      "1 \t\t This series ran from 2005 to 2014, but I've never watched it before.I have a lot on my plate right now, so I've binge-watched only a few episodes so far, and I put it in my \"watch later list\".At first I thought that this series is not up my alley, cuz I don't like \"Friends\" (oops) and I hate that audience laugh in the background. But, oh my gosh, how wrong was I!I know that it is way too soon to draw any conclusions, anyway I'm one hundred percent sure that it's a brilliant sitcom. And, you know, it made me laugh, even though I actually don't like such kind of series.I love the story, the cast, the jokes. It's a perfect go-to series when you want to escape from the reality and have some fun.Every character is perfectly developed. The plot is interesting. You will never know what's gonna happen in the next episodes.If you haven't watched it yet, just give it a go. You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "0 \t\t How can I say it respectfully? hmm.... It's disgustingly boring and insultingly illogical.I admit that season 1 and 2 were extremely well made. Maybe it is the reason why I am now extremely disappointed. The writers only uses tricks of \"sudden turns of events\" to generate funny moments. Having watched many episodes of this show, all I see is that characters constantly changing their beliefs, decisions, and actions back and forth without any logical reasons: we two must break up, no, we must get back together, no, that's just impulse, we should still break up, no, that's true love, we must get back together, no, it's true love because we wanted it to be, we should break up...... The show is not making too much sense now. The five figures in the show don't have consistent characters any more. You can not ask such questions: \"how could this person possibly do such a thing?\" Because you won't have any logical answers. Maybe this is exactly what American shows are about: like fast food, you don't need to enjoy it, just swallow what is given to you. Sometimes, you stop and think \"wait a minute, this doesn't make sense, doesn't XX just did something exactly the opposite a minute ago?\" No, you can't. The writers just throw to you another contradictory joke and you are moving on.I feel deeply insulted watching the show. I feel that the writers assume that audience never think deeper than the superficial meaning of the jokes while watching shows, which is not true.Deeply disappointed.\n",
      "1 \t\t It is relatable, funny and you care about the people. How I Met Your Mother has everything a good show needs!\n",
      "1 \t\t I really wanted to love this show. I absolutely loved Friends and was told this was about the same. It is not. Apart from Barney (He is the best part of the show by far and congrats on Neil Harries for his performance), characters are childish and the script seems childish too. There is not much sense a plenty of nonsense. Yes, there was plenty of childish in Friends too, but somehow more mature and definitely more funny. Sadly this TV Show didn't make it for me\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of the very few sitcoms I seem to laugh out loud to - every time. I can't remember any series that has done the same thing for me since the first seasons of Seinfeld. Well, and Scrubs.Why? It's easy (well, not easy to do, but to describe): Great cast, compelling stories, good and original scripts and story lines. AND lots of warmth. Seeing (and hearing) Neil Patrick Harris as Barney is just wonderful. He shines beautifully with his cynical and cool \"awesomeness\". Josh Radnor as Ted is a guy a totally can identify myself with, and I guess that is something that really brings home the money for this show. He has it all. The goofy couple of Jason Segel (Marshall) and Alyson Hannigan (Lily) is a perfect match, both as a couple and in the cast, and Cobie Smulders as Robin is just as beautiful and tough as you wish your dream girl to be. I just saw all the episodes of the first season during the weekend, and it was so totally awesome and heartwarmingly funny that I'm still kind of stunned. I wish it will continue for a very, very long time. The best ensemble sitcom since Friends - no doubt in my mind!! Well, OK, Scrubs - maybe...;)\n",
      "0 \t\t Cheap, despicable laughs. I have no reason why this show is even mildly enjoyable to many people. It's terrible. There's so many better shows I really can't see a reason for this show to even exist.\n",
      "1 \t\t I started watching this show in 2019, totally expecting it to disappoint given the hype but I walked away blown away and find myself literally rewatching the entire series every 4 months or so. I am absolutely in love despite the ending, which is something I've totally come to understand.. to those who can't accept the ending, I totally see where you're coming from but the more I rewatch the show, the more I see the hints at the ending sprinkled throughout every season. I have learned so much from this masterfully written show and in some ways it parallels my own life because as a 26 yr old myself it's been difficult finding \"The One\".. but Ted and his friends persevere through every challenge and roadblock in their lives and always had each other when it hit the fan. I love this show and it will forever be one of my favorite shows of all time. It's Witty, funny, charming, sad, depressing and hopeless at times but in the end I wouldn't trade this show for anything.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is a great show. It has the same freshness and funny quirkiness that \"Friends\" had when it first started. The writing on this show is excellent and they have managed to keep qualify level up for almost every episode. You don't get the same \"generic sitcom\" crap that you find so often. This show is smart and funny and the characters are really likable. As with \"Friends\" you wish this was your circle of friends.As for the cast, Josh Radnor is fine as the \"lead\" but the true strength of \"How I Met Your Mother\" comes from the supporting case. Veterans Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris get all of the best lines and they make the most of them. Buffy and Doogie fans will not be disappointed. Likewise, new-comers Jason Segel and Cobie Smulders really complete the show and elevate the show from \"ok\" to \"excellent.\"Next to \"Prison Break\" this is my favorite new show of this season.\n",
      "1 \t\t this show is hilarious. Totally funny. I love every bit of it. The Ted average guy, the cynical successful Barney, the crazy in love Marshall, the wanna be perfect couple Lily and the sexy independence Robin.Ted is telling his kids in 2030 about how he met his wife (their kids' mother). The story circle around how Ted tried to find a date or future wife. Ted is kind of guy next door trying too hard. Barney which is played by Neil Patrick is awesome. He is really created the perfect Barney. Too much testosterone and too much self confidence. Marshall is kind of naive and desperately in love with Lily. Marshall and Lily don't have any secret. They told each other everything. Every single thing. Robin is quiet independence but very lovely, everybody can fall for her directly. The casts are great. They really into it. Well not totally perfect. But this can be the next big thing in TV.\n",
      "1 \t\t Its wonderful, hilarious and a lot fun watching this show. It has various aspects of life, mostly relationship together with friendship and family. Every character here is so fun to watch. And honestly this show has a true life element and most importantly this show has that ability, an ability to express various feelings, be it happy or sad, in a truly interesting and comforting way. At the end, all the memories that you have either it be sad or happy, it would make you remember it in a sweet way. It was a great time, watching this show. Were Lily and Marshall meant for each other? Will Barney just hook up with one another? Will Ted meet the love of his life? Will robin ever be someone's wife? To find out all these and more, watch HIMYM. :)\n",
      "1 \t\t I hate this show, but my husband loves it. All of the characters are hard to like and the same scenarios happen over and over. Really dislike watching it. 5 stars still because I have to admit I have laughed.\n",

      "Wasted time thanks\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is hilarious, it's partly satirical on sit coms and it makes it so much better. There are some very outlandish episodes and situations, and it's ridiculous and so funny. You barely even need to know what's happening to watch any episode. It is also very good at backtracking, something will be mentioned very early in one season and doesn't come back up until the end of a season or even a season or two later and it lines up exactly as it should.\n",
      "1 \t\t So i watched this series years back when i was in my early 20s. Now I'm in my early 30s and I've started to reminisce on some old tv shows and this was one of them. Me just like everyone else who watched the show when the finale ended did not like the ending at all. I was very disappointed but I rewatched the show cos why spoil 8 seasons of fun for one bad season. However, my whole perception of it changed the second time around. Since I already knew what was gonna happen I started paying attention to other parts and if you watch closely there are so many instances where it is hinted that the mother is gonna die especially toward the last few seasons. Also it is very clear throughout that Ted would end up with Robin. All the signs were there if you look closely. So although I am still a bit bummed that they spent a full season on Barney and Robins wedding I still that there was some important parts in the season. So all in all I do not think it ended bad, I think it ended exactly as it should have because let's face it Ted and Robin were end game. Also Ted and Robin got exactly what they wanted before they ended up together. Ted got the kids he always wanted and Robin got to travel the world. So it was a win win.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show. It has amazing character roster and the development of characters like Barney is just amazing, the story is great with many happy and sad moments. The plot twists are amazing tho the last episode I did not enjoy. The characters has amazing chemistry that I have not seen in any other show. The whole show is Perfect in my eyes love Every episode and season. The acting is great and i love the way the story is Told. Barney is my favorit character and i think Ted was Boring but i loved all of Them. This show is a show you need to watch. The story was interesting from the beginning. So If you are reading this, you need to watch it, you will fall in love with the characters and the show. The chemistry is just the best I have ever seen. All the characters develop in a line to make them much better in the last season. Also all the running jokes they make are just amazing. Bye hope this is not that bad👍\n",
      "1 \t\t When i first heard about this show, i thought that the show will be as cheesy as the name of the show. But the pilot episode really proved me wrong. The acting was, i think , as funny as it was in friends pilot. the one person that i liked the most was Lily played by Alyson hannigan who also came in Buffy the vampire slayer. Her silly acting reminds me of her role on American pie. She really brought a lot of colors in the show. The way her boyfriend proposed to her 9 her boyfriend is played by actor Jason Segel) was amazing. It really cracked me up. One more amazing person one this show is Neil Patrick Harris who i think represents Joey but is kind of gentleman. Neil plays best friend of Jason and Josh ( who is the main guy in the story) and always ask them to ware a suit so girls will like it. And now comes Josh (who plays Ted) i think that his acting was average funny. Some of the things he said were really funny but some were not that funny. The end part was really funny when the future Ted tell his kids \"Thats how i your 9he said something besides mother) so we don't know who the girl really is.\n",
      "1 \t\t It's a good show but the characters are a bit shallow. You can feel they're actors. Friends is 'creepingly' so natural it feels real.\n",
      "And how I met your mother has way too many unrealistic plots.\n",
      "Entertaining though. Love the actor Neil Patrick Harris. Hate the character. And a bit of a sexiest show.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is inspired by friends.\n",
      "Changed coffee shop to bar, monica's place to lily and ted and marshall's, the sofa scene\n",
      "1 \t\t From the start story revolved between ted and robin and it didn't work but i knew they would end up together in the end. But in season 9 when robin and barney were getting married and the most season9 was about them i skip the season mostly because i didn't like the way ending was going but in the end robin and ted finally end up together but its too short another final episode would've made for ted and robin specially.\n",
      "0 \t\t Why the hell did I watch this whole show for 9 seasons? And why does this abomination gets more then 8 stars on IMDb? The amount of really infantile jokes in this piece of crap show are uncountable. I gave it two stars instead of one because of the first two seasons were OK. But then every new season got worse until we got to the climax of unbearable to watch. It's gone that far for me that I have grown a total disgust for the majority of the cast. The three that I can absolutely not stand anymore are Alyson Hannigan, Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel. Alyson Hannigan sounds like she has forgotten to blow her nose for a decade, I don't think I laughed once with any of her \"jokes\" in nine seasons. Neil Patrick Harris, the so called womanizer of the show (I'll never get why by the way) is so annoying it is painful to watch. His repetitive humor with his high fives and whatever other fives, his bro code etc are branded in my ears and I will probably never be able to watch anything else that he is in without a feeling of disgust. Jason Segel has the kind of face you want to hit. With his humor he could not even get a smile from a five year old. Josh Radnor and his constant questioning of everything gets so boring that at the end you don't even want to know anymore how he met his wife. The only mildly decent actor must be Cobie Smulders. The only mistake she made was signing for this ridiculous series. I still don't get how I managed to watch this till the end. I must be a masochist.\n",
      "1 \t\t It was a legen... Wait for it.... Dary emotional rollercoaster ride. Except for final 2 minutes of the series I Loved everypart of it, hell I'm not even mad about that last 2 minutes either. Just it would have been fine without it too. All in all it was a great great show.\n",
      "1 \t\t Quick context: I love American TV comedies; I've been watching Friends, Arrested I'm giving it a solid 8-9 for the very first seasons; which were fun and interesting. But unlike Friends, the characters aren't very lovable in general, despite good work from the actors and the great character/actor match of Barney Stinson/Neil Patrick Harris. And since the general setup doesn't change much over the course of the 9 seasons, it quickly becomes more and more painful to watch as the newness runs out.The last (9th) season (or at least the first 5 episodes, but I bet that it won't get better) deserves a very special spot in the hall of fame of really bad, bad TV. It really seems as if they took the material for 8 episodes and stretched it as much as they could to make an entire season.\n",
      "1 \t\t As for me \"How I met...\" from the first moment on filled the breach \"Friends\" left open. Of course it's not just some substitute, it also shows its own qualities. Biggest plus perhaps is that its a very natural. Many episodes deal with certain aspects of daily live. Aspects most of us are familiar with. Often it's something you haven't seen too often during other shows. For those who don't know \"How I met...\" yet, I recommend to start with season 1 - which was the best season so far and a great way to get into this show. The other seasons so far are good but probably you'll find them not as outstanding.In a short: One of the best comedy shows these days.\n",
      "1 \t\t Ok I have something to get off my chest about the ending of HIMYM. Almost everyone hated it. And I did too. But this scene and other real, emotional, and gut wrenching scenes made me realize that this show is about life. For everyone. You can cling on the the past and try to keep everyone together and happy, but life moves on. People move on, fade, etc. When the gang is all split up at the end of the show, it shows how everyone moves on with their lives. How real life can be. Barney and Robin get divorced because of their jobs. Lily and Marshal are busy traveling and taking care of their kids. Ted is with Tracy and the kids until she dies, something that can happen to any of us anytime. It's all real. It wasn't the typical happy ending that every sitcom gets. It was the real life ending that real life gets. It's not always happy. It's not always a perfect ending. Times change and so must people.The whole point of Ted telling the kids the story of how he met Tracy was to move on. The kids moved on and now it's time for Ted to move on. He did, in some way, get his happy ending. He got to be with the love of his life, Tracy, and had kids. But it's time for a new chapter.I do think they could've done the ending better but I also think that it is very under-appreciated.\n",

      "0 \t\t 9 Seasons??? Really??? What a total waste of time... Seriously why does  it still air...?? Hell, even \"joey\" was better than this piece of  crap... Actors act like ten year old children in a school play... Dull  sceneries... Please tell me whom I have to blame for approving the  pilot episode???   A show about a guy who informs his children of how he met their mother  by telling them about his irrelevant relationships, long enough to see  his own kids going to retirement by the time he finishes his story...  Whats the point here...??? - \"Hey dad, how did you met our mother???\" -  \"Well... I had about 100 relationships that ended bad but don't worry I  ll tell you everything about them...\"  That lame character is supposed to be an architect when he cant even  answer a simple question? Its like asking how many are 2 plus 2  oranges??? And the answer is.... Well... First it was space, then the  planets, then... then there were seeds initially, then they grow to  trees... and going on and on until his kids die of boredom or lack on  food on the same chair. Finally the worst part of all...  - Eh, no that wasn't actually what happened... its... , Oh no I don't  remember... oh I do now... Or was it the other way around???  Its a really bad copy of FRIENDS without a sign of humor... I do  believe and hope that people are smart enough to see that...  Please do humanity a favor and stop that thing from airing... PLEASE!!!  I am begging you...\n",
      "1 \t\t There is always a battle among netizens on which show is good, 'friends' or 'how i met your mother'. I think both are equally good (and dear to me). It is like, HIMYM picked up stories from where FRIENDS had left. I like to say, both are 'sister series', happening in same New York story-world; because both follows same premise- 'the show is about group of friends hanging out together and figuring out life and relationships.' (One can include 'the big bang theory' too.)\n",

      "Season 9 - 3Watched it non-stop. Loved its characters... the story telling... the time jumping... the hurts and aches and pains of love...the solid ground that friendship brings...the growing up... the regressing until the lesson is really learned this time...the humor that comes from life itself.Everything about it was perfect all the way up until the ending, which, to me, just didn't work. Last season could have been used to tell the story that they rushed and tried to squeeze into the finale.Still. If you like ensemble sit-com shows, put this one on your viewing list. It's not too late.\n",
      "1 \t\t I think like many other people I came to HIMYM because I was a huge Buffy fan and would really watch anything with Alyson Hannigan in it (except for Date Movie which even I had to give up on!). She was very good in this and it was also nice to see all the many Whedonverse alumni who turned up during the course of the show, Amy Acker, Kal Penn, Tom Lenk etc I originally hoped that The Mother would turn out to be played by Sarah Michelle Gellar or Eliza Dushku.The show itself was clever, well written and acted and never stopped being entertaining, the constant stream of incredible hotties courted by Ted and especially Barney also a huge plus. For my money Barney was the breakout character whose catchphrases will be remembered long after the rest of the show is forgotten and who must surely qualify as one of the great TV womanisers (perhaps all the more remarkable as being played by an openly gay man?). The only character I really never took to was Marshall who was supposed to be the everyman but who really never appealed to me much, he just seemed like a waste of space.The plotting was clever with so many twists and turns keeping us on edge about who the mother was and milking it for all it was worth. When we finally got to meet her she was everything we (and Ted) could have hoped for and we took to the character amazingly well considering the limited screen time she garnered. I was okay with the twist ending although I would have liked a few scenes with the gang comforting Ted and his kids at her funeral or maybe them placing some flowers on her grave. Certainly a show that gave us a bevy of new catchphrases, from 'Suit up!' to 'Legend-dary' and let us not forget 'The Naked Man!'.\n",
      "1 \t\t I have no words to describe this show. It has me speech less, it is my comfort show. I probably watched this show and finished it about 2 years ago, but till this day I watch bloopers and scenes on Youtube. I feel like Ted and barney and Robin and Lilly are my actual best fiends. And when I finished watching it I had a full week of depression. I have watched all of the most famous shows and none of them hit like HIMYM. I would pay good money just to get the feeling I first got watching the show. They were my friends my family. I love the show with all my heart I am in tears writing this. It was truly a show to remember. I fully recommed watching it. I made this account just to review this loving show.\n",
      "1 \t\t The series was a solid eight when I saw it the first time, the first two seasons were the best, it got a bit downhill from there, and the final season was just dreadful, yet I did not punish the entire series based on that season, I was in the hate the ending team also. Upon a rewatch I disliked the series a bit more in general, my favorite character is Marshal, Lily being a strong second, Barney was always funny and Ted and Robin were just OK, what changed after rewatch is that the ok characters became really annoying, Barney became disturbing, I just could not stand Robin and Ted, he was just unbearable. Funny thing, though I continued to hate the last season, the ending did not seem as bad, my major pet peeve, why do you focus a whole season into a wedding of two characters you'll divorce, I agree with people saying it was obvious they would not last, but still, it was a whole damn season!.\n",
      "1 \t\t What amazes me most about this show is how close it is to situations everyone of us has been through. Each actor can relate to their character, one can tell after watching only little of the show.The choice of music, created atmosphere and the very perceptive way in which this show has been created can not be described, not to mention that it is just hilarious.Everyone knows a \"Ted\", most of us know a \"Marshal and Lily\" couple, some of us are friends with a typical \"Barney\", and everyone seems to find him/herself somewhere in that show.Carter/Bays managed to put together a show that everyone in their late 20s will love, and I am pretty sure that most of the stories being told are based on actual experience.Which matters most to me and most people who love the show, is consistency. Everything is connected, a long story is being told and nothing from a previous episode will be forgotten or ignored.10 out of 10 points for three wonderful seasons that kept me in front of my TV without once having to complain about a stupid joke or a lame episode.one HUGE p.s.: Forget about season 4. I don't know if the show got pressure from the network to change the original recipe, but that's exactly what they did. Events are not connected any more. The show is no longer continuous and every character is now made fun of and seems ridiculous in his/her own way, so the serious and lovable heart of the show has been ripped out, maybe to address a wider range of viewers. I hope, season 5 will pick up where they left off at the end of season 3, but just so you know: - Season 1-3 are highest quality comedy (10/10) - Season 4 is average slapstick at best (4/10)\n",
      "1 \t\t The tight friendship of these 5 people has always been what's drawn me to the show. It's warm and sweet to watch them supporting each other. It's entertaining tho some jokes are quite flat. I truly like Ted as a character and his relationship with Robin. Tho I do get why people are upset that a wedding lasting few seasons can just fall out in 10 min.One thing I really don't like is Barnet's character. His toxic masculinity disgust me and I don't understand why so many people like him.\n",
      "1 \t\t You can't help relate this series to another one about a group of friends and even though there are many similarities, this is not trying to be the same at all and have it's very own story to tell.This is about our main character Ted and his closest friends, how he and they see their lives and all about what is stated in the title, how Ted meet the mother of his two kids he is telling the entire story to. Ted is the narrator and we get the story told by him as he is telling it to his kids, we never know who it actually is that is their mother and that is the whole point. It is a very detailed story and the kids really get a lot of information about girlfriends, \"slutty\" uncle Barney and much more you might not tell your kids :)Really a good and funny series, with many episodes that relate to each other and many strange scenes that fit together in the end. It is a long, but great and funny journey along side the five main characters, with a lot of steady side characters and an elaborate scene of events that leads up to the big moment of meeting the mother.\n",
      "0 \t\t As a big FRIENDS fan, I always delayed watching HIMYM. But after it came out on Netflix, I decided to give it a shot.I was surprised, the first 3 seasons weren't that bad. It's not near as good as FRIENDS, but it was still pretty good. But then..After season 5, it's like the writers lose inspiration every single season. In season 5 and 6, there were still some funny and emotional moments. But the last 3 seasons were just a pure waste of time. The jokes were forced and not at all funny. I didn't had to laugh even once during season 9. The show is called How I Met Your Mother and we only meet the mother at the end of season 8 and only see her for like 10 episodes.. This show just rambled on for much too long. 6 seasons would have been fine.And what is up with all the sex jokes?? It's like all they talk about. Well to conclude. First seasons: 8/10. Last seasons: 2/10. So 4/10 in total. I was afraid this show was going to beat FRIENDS, but honestly, it doesn't even come close.\n",
      "1 \t\t Indeed my title will give away the theme of this review. It is a positive one but that does not mean the show does not have it's fair share of problems. As a viewer who has watched all episodes up to date I personally feel the creators ,Bays and Thomas deserve a special mention to this show. The editing, plot and the general format of the story line is pure brilliance. The follow up to every scene turns out to be just the opposite and in this way the term clichéd never hits the show, and as a viewer you will find yourself laughing throughout. Personally almost every moment just before the title song kicks in post season 2 is a true laugh out loud moment.Next up is the direction of the show. Since the show is always narrated each episode can be about a random event that occurred during the characters lives. This way a lot of issues are addressed which are great but sometimes the plot gets a little too out of hand and here comes the negative aspect of the show. Some episodes are total genius and the best ever to have aired on television ad some are downright horrible which make's you think why on earth are you even watching this. Fans of the show will definitely agree with me when i say the overall quality has been deteriorating and since season 5 episodes keep falling down. I hope this gets fixed soon and lastly bring in the mother already. We still haven seen the mother(except her foot) which is annoying. The characters are amazing.Not something that can be written to explain but something that has to be watched in order to get an idea of the genius and creative ideas behind the makers of this show. Lastly i must say watch this show with an open mind. I strongly believe the makers are drawing a finer line between real life and a cartoon which in my opinion is awesome. give it a shot you will not be disappointed. I am giving this show a rating of 8 instead of a 9 simply because of the drag in season 5.\n",
      "1 \t\t I liked this series over all, I really truly did....until the series finale. As it turns out, we were lied to the entire time, in a way. Where as Robin is not the \"mother\" she is the step-mother as she ends up with Ted after the mother dies. They just should have made Robin the mother as the actress playing the mother was unappealing to me and did not have chemistry with Josh Radner that played Ted. I have never watched this series again since \"the lie\" and will not watch the new father one either, fool me once and all. And it's a shame too because Neil Patrick Harris was excellent as Barney!\n",
      "0 \t\t The protagonist in this sitcom - Ted Mosby - is a dull, pretentious, old-acting young man. Throughout this show, he's desperate to marry and have children - yet dumps girls for petty reasons. He has a dull personality, is old-fashioned and socially inept - yet inexplicably gets a lot of hot girls. He's a weak centre to an otherwise well-above-average sitcom. In many ways, he's similar to Friends' Ross Geller. Barney is the most entertaining character.The title is misleading, because The Mother doesn't feature in the vast majority of episodes.The final series is a disappointing, drawn-out exercise that's mostly about (unsuited couple) Barney and Robin's wedding.\n",
      "1 \t\t There was a time when i considered HIMYM as the best ever sitcom..even above friends..but season 7 and now season 8 have proved to be great disappointments. After the dismal season 7 I was hoping the worst was over but here we are in season 8 and things don't seem to be improving. Few things that i have noticed: 1. Most of the stories are in flashback (so that makes the show flashback-in-flashback) 2. Stories have become more and more distant from reality and hence any attempt to induce laughter seems superficial. 3. Characters seem old and droopy. 4. Setup seems overcrowded and overstuffed, specially Lily and Marshall's apartment. It is kinda irritating. What exactly is happening to HIMYM? Honestly I don't care anymore who the mother is!!\n",
      "0 \t\t HIMYM seemed to peak at around series two but at the moment (series 5) some of the recent episodes have been just 20 minutes of one joke with a prolonged punchline of which I did not not interesting in the first place. As time increases the format becomes more strained and the episode quality varies which I feel is due to the change in writers for many of the episodes.Cobie Smulders as Robin is a totally boring and pointless character though the others are likable though Ted continues to become more pathetic.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show was one of the best once it starts till almost season 6, and I wish they end it there.It becomes so boring, they don't concentrate on the story anymore, a lot of (garbage if I can say that) just to fill the timing of the episodes. Especially this last season it screws everything, I watch complete episode, not even with one smile.Anyway, if you want to watch this series, you're going to forward a lot while playing after season 5 or 6 (boring alert :)Comparing to TBBT show, I believe TBBT still holding to number 1 for me and How I met your mother lost it's flavor big time.\n",
      "1 \t\t You will notice, when something comes on TV that has originality written over it. Because we have been bombarded with rehashed material, since the end of 'Friends' and 'Seinfeld', you can smell it when something is fresh and original. '30 Rock' is the show that dominates the comedy charts, but there one another show that has consistently cooked up original script and jokes for the last 5 seasons. 'How I met your mother' may not be on the must win list of the award ceremony, but it is definitely worth tuning in every Monday night for the ever dragging wait to let two kids in 2030 New York to know, How their Father met their Mother. Started in 2005, the story started in similar fashion like the ever classic 'The Wonder Years'. Ted Mosby starts narrating his now teenage kids in 2030, his life story in 2005 New York that eventually leads to him meeting the girl of his dream, i.e. the mother of these teenage kids. While the scenario is interesting, the story has to go beyond meeting your future wife, for the series to have a lifeline of at least five to seven seasons. That's where the intellectual strength of the creator comes in and involves one of the most provocative and likable sitcom characters since; oh most definitely since 'Seinfeld'. Though 'Lily', 'Marshal' and 'Robin' create a good mix along with 'Ted', it is 'Barney' playfully played by Neil Patrick Harris that lift the show several notches higher. His 'Barney' is so weird and a creep that his dark comedy creates a sense of shock amid all the 8.00 o'clock light comedies. Neil gives the character a suave edge, with the characters fetish love for wearing suites. He is the master who in almost every episode takes 'Ted' to a very Bachelor adventures that every guy would love to venture; albeit with better results each time. 'Robin' played by Cobie Smulders, is Teds first romantic flame. While, it is 'Lily' played by Alyson Hannigan of American Pie fame that keeps the female characters on the edge of dark humor. Overall, a great cast that has not failed to entertain for the last 5 seasons and would continue to entertain us for a few more seasons. With no competition from other sitcoms it is a must for all you lovers of Seinfeld and Friends because the flavor is back with original materials to make us laugh. Hi fives everyone.\n",

      "1 \t\t I've seen this show 5 times and everytime it makes me laugh, makes my eyes watery. You think it's just a comedy show but several times it makes you cry. (SPOILERS) Especially when Marshall gets dumped, his father dies and when Ted's wife saying good bye to her husband. Amazing how you can laugh so much but still get the reel feels of loss and happiness. I cannot say who's my favorite because all 5 are incredible. Superb show 👏\n",
      "1 \t\t This serie is one the most beautiful I have ever seen. It is really brilliant, in fact despite the many seasons, has kept its originality. It manages to combine dramatic and important themes with playful ones, without ever being boring.\n",

      "0 \t\t I really, really love this show, it is really special. Characters, casting, the quality is not like Chuck Lorrie, so the quality declines after the 6th season, everything is great.BUT... I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY THE 'MOTHER' is SO, SO, SO, UGLY! The cast is great, but this girl is totally UGLY, Ted had so many better girls, they were all better than his 'wife', the ONE who will be his wife. Did Cristin Milioti sleep with some casting people to get this part? She is so UGLY. This part ruined the whole thing, that's why I didn't give 10 stars to this show. I really don't know how people can ruin all good work in a last season. This girl has bed teeth, bad smile, everything is bad related to her. Every Ted's girlfriend could be the ONE, instead of her.\n",
      "1 \t\t Barney is the best. I just love him. His sense of dialogue delivery, character, mannerisms, punch lines, one liners and infinite variations of high fives, he was just legen-wait for it-dary. Legendary.\n",

      "Up until season 9's episode 22, this is my all time best romantic sit com ever. The last two episodes ruined everything.\n",
      "But still, the bad parts are nothing compared to the good parts.\n",
      "You'll laugh. You'll feel romantic. You'll cry. You'll have goosebumps even.\n",
      "A must watch.\n",
      "1 \t\t I never understood the appeal of this show and I've watched countless hours of it. First Ted and Robin the 2 main characters are the most boring and wooden characters on the show. The cast is amazing with Harris, Segel, and Hanningan yet the focus for 90% percent of the show was on Radnor and Smulders. If you would have put Segel and Hannigan in the main or Harris and Hannigan in the main the show would have been a lot better than finishing in the top 50 never finishing under 42 for the season. This is another show where you can raid the fridge or take a bathroom break anytime and as often as you want without feeling that you've missed much.\n",
      "0 \t\t I don'r know what is the problem with fat people .. it's like every 2 episode there is an insult for fat people .. I mean didn't they consider people's feeling? Specially fats by sickness!! My God this is so wrong!Everytime I start liking an episode this problem just take me out of it.\n",
      "1 \t\t Missing out opportunities is my thing and it struck me once again when I started watching the series so late. There have been many sitcoms that we have enjoyed and many of them have tried to get to you by showing the real life as close as possible but making it more fun and adventurous. Take 'Friends' for example - legendary creation that will be with us as long as we live, however, 'How I met your mother' not only tries to connect with you, it succeeds on all levels, so let me tell why and hopefully I will be faster than Ted Mosby.The trick that has been pulled was used everywhere: introduce you to a group of characters and set you on following their steps. Pretty unoriginal you say, but then there always is a way to feed you awesome stories that will struck with their unbelievable plots and cracking moments, which the series excels at.If it was the major move of the writers the series would be acceptable for late night gobbling of junk food and relaxing your brains after the tiring day, but no. The genius of the HIMYM is in extreme exaggeration of the characters that represent everyone that is watching. Every member of the gang is inside you, unlike the same 'Friends' that in my opinion are more comedic creations. Imagine your romantic feelings sharpened to the state of Japanese katana, childish behavior let loose as you are not adult any more, perverted desires as there is no tomorrow and fun bursting like Vesuvius at his trip to Pompeii.Like every other sitcom, watching it is like breathing air and exciting feeling arises even if you turn on a random episode. Love those threads of stories that go on through several episodes and sometimes through several seasons, they bring up nostalgic feelings even when you watch for the first time.Long story short, HIMYM is a big hilarious life lesson that you will remember better than school classes. Characters will stay in your mind and heart leaving a warm feeling of perfection and ultimate friendship. If my soul could scream, it would tell everyone to watch the series and if I could time travel, I would come back to younger me, slap that ignorant dummy and stick the entire collection in his hands.\n",
      "1 \t\t Right from the start, you hardly won't sympathize with the whole gang. Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) being the romantic guy, always in the search for his soul-mate. Barney Stinson(Neil Patrick Harris), the womanizer, the funny guy of the group and with NPH's spectacular performance and charisma, Barney Stinson has become a memorable character along with his catchphrases. Marshall Eriksen(Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a lawyer who cares a lot about the environment and a kindergarten teacher with a dream of being a painter or in somehow be part of the art world. Despite the ups and downs, they remained faithful and truthful to each other, providing endless moments in which through their love demonstrations the purity of love is exalted, and Robin Scherbatsky(Cobie Smulders), a workaholic and the reason of many troubles along the way. It was legendary seeing this group growth and development. Who didn't love the countless adventures they went through, the beautiful and romantic moments such as the Stella 2-min date, the Marshall and Lilly updated vows or Barney's proposal, The Robin. Those events made us see how charming and captivating love is. But let's not forget HIMYM wasn't just a sitcom full of happiness and fun times, there were some sad and tragic situations too, as Robin's talk to her never born children, Marshall's father death and the Ted's desperate speech to his future wife in her apartment. The idea of just giving glimpses of Ted's Wife, Tracy McConnell (Cristin Milioti), was brilliant, keeping the audience anxious to meet her and wonder how she would be like. Another worthy mentioning aspect is the soundtrack, its use is smart and clever, whether a sad or happy music, it fits very well, increases the scene's impact and manages to create many unforgettable, heart-breaking stories. Throughout the series, when Ted, the narrator, talked about Tracy, we could notice the love and care he felt for her but the series finale deconstructed most of things.Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, the creators, wanted a more realistic and less goofy finale, it's understandable. The problem is how they did it, the execution. If the mother's death had been treated with greater care with the aim of showing the grief and sadness that the group was suffering, showing the pain Ted was being through, because the audience took nearly eight seasons to meet her and when they do in the last season which is in charge of building up a character so expected, something that really happens, as it is quite hard not to fall for Tracy,her death is treated with such indifference and disregard. With this different ending would still be a shock but we would see the mourning that the characters were feeling and with it as in real life we would have our time of grief to perhaps in the future accept this tragic ending, the feeling of reality which the creators always wanted to pass would be noticed. But instead, they did it like if it was just something irrelevant and trivial. Right after this blow, Ted decides to go after Robin again, making feel like the mother was just another step to conquer Robin's love. Although How I Met Your Mother's polemic finale, the series is undoubtedly worthy watching, because what really matters in life is not the end, but the journey and with no doubt their journey is legendary.\n",
      "0 \t\t Everyone compares this show with Friends, some say it's even better than Friends. I say I love Friends and I really, really hate this show. I hate its darkish interiors (why is every room in the show so depressive?), I hate most of the characters (Ted is the worst), I hate Barney's clichés (how could this awkward guy become one of the most quoted characters ever?) and since fifth season I hate it all as it's not funny, its repetitive and",
      "it's just as bad as it could be. I really tried to be more open minded and gave it a second chance (mainly due to the lately lack of sitcoms in my collection), but I just don't work. The fact that it is one of the best rated shows urges me even more to be a bit extreme in its rating, otherwise I would consider it as just one of the 5 stars, completely forgettable attempt to reach the heights of Friends.\n",
      "0 \t\t Pretentious, clueless. one-dimensional, and mostly unfunny. \n",
      "I never liked this show when it was aired even though most people around back then loved it. Now, after years I thought the test of time will render it pointless and put it in place, but no. People still admire this crap and I really don't know why - it's awful.The writing, characters, stories, are horrible and to think it won some Emmys makes one think how valid are the Emmys (it was for a stupid category anyway, nothing of value really).The only reason I wont give it a 1 star is that it had some good actors, and that it did, whether I like it or not, shape the pop culture with some situations and catchphrases, and that has endured.Lastly, I agree with CrenshawPete review, so please read that for more specific points.\n",
      "0 \t\t How I met your mother was recommended by a so called \"friend\" it was an utter disappointment. there was no memorable moments apart from when I almost ended everything mid way through the first episode. I would rather drink bleach every time barney talks rather than listen to his forgetful lines of dialogue written by 8 year old kids with some sort of syndrome. This is a 1 out of 10 would not recommend to anyone (even Hitler)as this sort of punishment should be left to Korean prisons as a way to turn pedophiles into vegetables. the best part about the entire series was when Marshalls dad died I could not wait for him to have that heart attack. This is the only reason its a 1 and not a 0. after watching the show I regret all of my life choices and wish I didn't meet your mother. overall I would rather watch the country bears over and over than watch this piece of cabbage malarkey.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show funnier every rewatch, last season kinda sucks.\n",
      "0 \t\t I don't know how the show became so popular. I watched only one season and i didn't laugh once. I smiled few times though. ( I watched it only because I downloaded it after hearing about it) The comedy is so childish and felt like they are imposing the comedy on the viewers. The story never moves... There is no life in the characters, and it looks very fictional. Barney is the amateur version of joy in friends, Stella is the worst form of Rachel, the husband (dont even remember his name) is a stone sculpture of Chandler, and Tobby wants to be Ross.. Each characters are based on Friends in its worst form.Just watch one episode and please come and rate it in IMDb to have a proper review score.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of my favorite sitcoms. Ted's search for the love of his life, Robin's life, Marshall and Lily's loves and my favorite character Barney's trying to sleep with people form the personalities of the main characters of the series. If you ask who is the funniest character in the series, I would say any kind of Barney. Because the story of the character is well written and when Neil Patrick Harris portrayed the character of Barney very well, something perfect came out. Although the places where the series takes place are very few, they are enough for a sitcom series. In the series, we also share in the downfalls and rises of the characters, we bond with the characters. If you're looking for a well-written, funny and good sitcom, How I Met Your Mother is for you.\n",
      "1 \t\t I have just finished watching season 1 and i wont say i love the show YET, but i do really like it and have enjoyed every episode so far. The acting is great and some of the scenes have hand on heart been heartbreaking. The way the show has you rooting for Ted and Robin to be together, only makes me wonder if they actually do end up together in the end...\n",
      "A truly bittersweet end to season 1 as Ted finally gets what he's been after; unfortunately for Marshal it seems Lily's done a runner :( i do hope she comes around because they are a good couple together. Ive seen alot of people praise Barney and i couldn't agree more, he's hilarious. Onto season 2...\n",
      "0 \t\t I have to say that this is a bad and unfunny show. It sucks ass because of bad acting and bad scripts. I can't lie, its very bad. I never understood how people liked this show as much as they apparently did. I have given it loads of chances and watched quite a lot of episodes, but I always land on the same conclusion = it sucks ass.\n",
      "1 \t\t how i me your mother should have ended in 22nd episode of ninth season. the last episode spoils the entire series.after showing Robin and Barney's wedding foe 22 episodes nobody ever expected that they would have expected that they would get divorce very next episode.Ted finally had met the woman of his life and had no more feelings for Robin but it was very stupid to show that his wife died and he still have feelings for Robin and reunite with Robin.it is a very awful ending i hate to tell this HIMYM was my favorite series ever but after i watched the final episode i started hating it after waiting this long for Ted to meet this dream girl and happy family his wife dies and the reunites with Robin. i really wanted Robin and Barney to be together at the end.Im extremely disappointed i have decided not to watch any series like this again.hope my review is helpful\n",
      "1 \t\t I love that they gave Aly a new show, she is so great and she deserves one. They stuck with the \"kinky girl\" persona the movie American Pie gave her, but I still like it. The show is funny and the characters are great. I can't wait to see who Ted ends up with. The TV show may be a little silly at times, but I like it a lot, and I intend to watch it every Monday night. I don't know if the show can have multiple seasons since it's a one story type of thing, but if they can figure out how to do it, then I hope they do it. Anyways, I give high praises to the show, and I hope it sticks around longer than some of these other TV series, like Head Cases. Kandis\n",

      "1 \t\t http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.comEver since the years with Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier providing an onslaught of sitcom laughs and fun, many have said that the sitcom was dead. Although the state of sitcoms will probably never reach that peak from the late 90's, CBS has made quite a splash with its two strong sitcoms: Two and a Half Men and How I Met Your Mother. I will praise Two and a Half Men in another review, but for now let me talk about Your Mother (I'm sorry, I just had to).How I Met Your Mother might be the most unconventional sitcom I have ever seen. Usually you have an incredibly simple premise: For example, a show about nothing, or a show about six friends who spend their days at a coffee house and their nights sleeping around. How I Met Your Mother plays off like the Memento of sitcoms",
      " you don't know anything about the characters, you don't know what's real or not, there are enough plot twists to spin your head, and it's told in flashback, and even the flashbacks have flashbacks.Its tagline reads: A love story in reverse. And that's exactly what it is. It starts off in the year 2030 with two kids seated on the couch. The off-screen narrator is Ted (voiced by Bob Saget) and he's telling his children the story about how he met their mother. He begins the story 25 years ago in the year 2005 and the adventure takes off. How I Met Your Mother has everything that makes a good sitcom. It has likable and unique characters: Ted (Josh Radnor) plays like the lovable loser Ross was in Friends, and then that makes Robin (Cobie Smulders) Ted's Rachel. Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lilly (Alyson Hannigan) are the cutest couple on TV. And then the scene stealing, hilarious Barney (the always brilliant Neil Patrick Harris) is the icing on the cake. On top of the characters being, as Barney would put it",
      " \"legendary,\" their on-screen chemistry is superb. You have no doubts that this fantastic five are actually friends in real life.The final thing that makes a good sitcom is good writing, and this is where I feel How I Met Your Mother breaks the boundaries. In addition to the writing being witty, entertaining, and funny, there's a level of depth that this show has over any other sitcom. There are layers of uncertainty that can either provide for a big laugh as well as drop your jaw to the floor. I didn't believe it at first when I read how even in the first episode there's a minor plot twist. I thought, \"Plot twist? In a sitcom? How could that work?\" But this show makes it work with ease because of its strong writing.There have been a lot of comparisons from How I Met Your Mother to Friends. Heck, that's how CBS marketed this show. They do share some similarities: The group of friends in a romantic-comedy genre, the New York City setting, the bar MacLaren's is their Central Perk hangout, and just the fact that the characters live way above their allowed means. But even when the show looks, sounds, and feels like a Friends rip-off",
      " it's not. How I Met Your Mother is wildly entertaining in its own, original way. The narrating, foreshadowing, surprises, and cliffhangers are just some reasons why this show is for anyone. If you haven't given this show a chance yet, all I have to say to you is you better SUIT UP and watch How I Met Your Mother.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great comedy that we will never see something like this again because ppl nowadays are incredibly stupidly sensitive with everything even comedy\n",
      "1 \t\t Best sitcom. Got everything in this series. Gets you crying gets u laughing. Best show!\n",
      "1 \t\t it was one of the greatest shows when it started. the characters were lovely, plot was interesting, jokes were fantastic. yeah, we all did think that it is very similar to friends, but they proved us wrong with its uniqueness of the plot. every new episode was new. overall, it was a warm TV show we all could empathize. at that time, it was hard for me to wait for a new episode. but, all i was thinking for the last 3 seasons that \"someone, please, put it out of its misery\". it was craving for ax for so long but the ax never came.glad it is gonna be over soon. i will just watch the very last episode just for the sake of completeness, and will try to reminisce the times when it was good.\n",
      "1 \t\t The only reason I really started watching this show is because it has Jason Segel, aka NICK ANDOPOLIS! in it. My sister was telling me about the first episode over the phone, and I was not interested.But after seeing an episode, I really started to dig this show! the little flashbacks, and twists, and P\"oor Li'l Ted\", who doesn't really treat himself as much as a victim as most shows would portray their protagonist.I really like the Sides that Ted has to deal with too:A) Barney, the Womanizer who is all OVER the damn place B) Marshall and Lily, who are naturally perfect for each otherthese two teams are polar opposites as Ted's friends, while Ted just sits in the middle having to deal with his decisions while viewing THESE two models.Anyways, Great Show, and even the Short Theme Song brings up my Spirits on a Monday Nite.PS if you like this show, check out \"The Class.\" Definitely not the same as this show, and not with the same taste, but a similar kind of cast, yet original. WORDPEACEBLAH\n",
      "0 \t\t It starts brilliantly, very funny and clever but the last few series kills it for me. To be honest, I wish I'd not seen how he met their mother and just had the mystery. They end it in the worst way possible and just try to reimagine the Friends will they won't they!\n",

      "0 \t\t I have recently started watching the old episodes of HIMYM. I forgot how funny and original the series was (even though some episodes reminded me of 'Friends').As I kept on watching the show I started to hate the characters, especially Lily and Ted.Everyday I tell myself that I will stop watching season 9. It is by far the worst season as they keep stretching the story plus they are trying to bring the old jokes/catch phrases back. Which just adds salt to the injury.The worst part is, when the series ends and after few years when you are sitting with your loved ones to recall the old HIMYM memories. the last season is just going to kill all the fun.Even though i was a big fan of the first few season. Im sad to say that they have lost my interest since the beginning of season 9.This is the only way i can shout out and say how much i hate season 9.\n",

      "1 \t\t Neil Patrick Harris is a genius. He steals nearly every scene. In the end I was less interested in how Ted found his wife but more interested in Barney & Robin. Superb ensemble though. Very funny.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is my favourite sitcom ever, the characters really became a reflection of my own life which is in a way sad but also awesome. It has helped me a lot with my own struggles. I would recommend this show to all people!\n",
      "1 \t\t I got all the seasons of this show on 2015. But it took 5 years for me to open that folder. It was there on my laptop for all these 5 years.\n",
      "And when i opened it on 2020...its LEGEND wait for it DARY !!!\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the first few seasons of this show. Everything about the show was great. All the lead characters were brilliant, especially Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson. His potrayal of the character was legend, wait for it, dary. Legendary. I loved all the other characters too. They provided the necessary balance and eccentricity to the group. Even thinking of the bridal shower scene makes me crack up. My roommate actually asked me if I'd gone crazy. Barney finally proposing Robin, and Marshall and Lily getting married everything is still fresh in my memory. And then the last two seasons ruined everything. The jokes were bland all of a sudden and I started getting a little impatient to see Ted finally meet Tracy. I hated how little screen time the couple got, they were simply made for each other. The worst part was Ted repeatedly going back to Robing and doing things for her that would normally make me how aww but it somehow annoyed me, probably because he did it less than a week from her wedding and the man she was marrying was one his best friends. I hated when Robin and Barney broke up and I hated it when Tracy died. But nothing was as horrible as Ted going back to Robin with that stupid blue French horn. Almost made me slam my laptop into the wall. I guess anyone who's watched the show will relate to this. But still I'll pretend the last episode didn't happen and be happy about the rest of the shoe.\n",
      "1 \t\t I liked this show from the first episode and I also loved the caracters and the story between them. For me, the ending is perfect. Totally recommend this show.\n",
      "1 \t\t And im serious... the storyline, jokes, and the cast without a single mistake. Im in ninth season of this hilarious sytcom, and I can't stop thinking about kidnapping Neil Patrick Harris, and forcing him to do more episodes.\n",
      "Watch this show on Netflix or anywhere else! Because if you will watch this show, you will find out that it's Legen... wait for it... dary!\n",
      "1 \t\t I began watching this show because Alyson Hannigan was is the cast and I'm a big fan of hers from \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\" where she played the character Willow Rosenburg. I had heard some not so good reviews about \"How I Met Your mother\" but I figured I would give it a shot.I was very pleasantly surprised at what I saw.This show has fantastic characters that I grew instantly attached to that are put in a new hilarious situation each episode. Of all the sitcoms I've seen i would have to say this is my favorite. The writing is fantastic and the acting is great. This is the kind of show you can watch over and over again and it will still be funny.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just caught this a few years ago in the summer when the first season reruns were airing and i thought it was absolutely brilliant. Generally i'm a sucker for sitcoms but this really caught my attention and made me a die hard fan. It makes me very happy that this show has been successful enough to have two fresh , innovative seasons that have maintained good ratings solidifying a good future.This show definitely is \"buddy\" humour along with irreverent, cute, charming, and random humour rarely does it get sexual, crude, or over the top. The characters are so three dimensional, relatable, and extremely well written it reminds you of Friends but not to the point that it becomes unoriginal. The show deals with real problems that occur for twenty somethings and mature, responsible ways of dealing with them.Their is definitely a Rachel/Ross atmosphere for both Lily and Marshall but also with Ted and Robin so yes there is a lot of sad/charming moments that mostly women will love. The best thing is that when an emotional part comes on it's always ended with a funny quote to keep the show upbeat and happy rather than depressing and sad.The characters are going to be legendary everyone will know Barney as much as they know Kramer, Robert, or Al Bundy when this show completes it's run i predict anywhere from 6-8 seasons. The other characters while not as over the top and original keep a good balance of lovable personalities stereotype free. The show has a nice way of telling stories throughout flashbacks and having flashbacks occur regularly much like Family Guy but with relevance to the plot and furthering the story.How I Met Your Mother is CBS's best show as of right now in my personal opinion because it's the one that is always catching you off guard with unpredictable moments and always keeping you interested and in love with the characters. Expect this to be a language trend setter like Seinfeld as the characters use nicknames for people, each other, and qualities i.e. The Crazy Eyes or Swarley. This show has a long future ahead of it hopefully it stays as quick witted and consistently funny as it has been these last two years. I look forward to season three of which i guarantee i'll watch each episode and look forward to every other season this brilliant show releases.\n",
      "1 \t\t What is this programme? Is it a comedy? It's not funny at all, like not even a bit. Listening to the main character moan and complain all the time makes me angry. Jesus this programme is so bad. I hate it\n",
      "1 \t\t The conclusion to the epic stories of how Ted Mosby met The One could not be more legen... wait for it... DARY! Nobody saw it coming. Loads of people hated it, surely, and that's understandable. After all, after years watching a TV show, it's not so much to ask for a fairy tale ending. That was not what happened though. The episode gave the message that was written all along the series: Things in our life won't always happen the way we want it. \"All we can do is promise to love each other with all that we've got...because love is the best thing we do\". That's what Ted's journey was all about. That's what really lasts forever.\n",
      "1 \t\t Compared to the other sitcoms I watched, How I Met Your Mother had a purpose, an outcome, everybody waits to meet the mother.I believe this might be the best sitcom ever created, considering the diversity of subjects, the personality of characters and the continuous and unrepeated narative thread.\n",
      "1 \t\t This was and always will be the best tv series I watched, just perfect. I felt like it was made for me.\n",
      "0 \t\t It's so so so bad! I love every actor, actress in this show but the script is awful!It's like everyone is only 15 years old, the writers just twisted and twisted and twisted even more so they can be kind of special from \"friends\".All the stories are sucks and so no serious like audiences are robots.Nothing is serious and meaning anything. Nothing make any sense!All the characters in the show are not trustworthy, vulgar, not loyal, also insulting women all the time.The only positive thing in this show is:\n",
      "if these characters in the show they can live their live like that stupid and repelling still can have happy life, so can you!!\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of the best sitcoms of recent history. I didn't get it when I watched the first couple of episodes when it first aired. But when I went back I fell in love with it. I have actually watched it from start to finish a few times. It really is a fun show. Going back and watching it again now I can see that Ted is a douche, but that's okay. The cast is perfect, Neil Patrick Harris is amazing as Barney. Love this one and always will.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is a wonderful journey, you get to know these beautiful characters and one man's journey to find his perfect soul mate. You get invested in this t.v. show.So when they end it so horrifically badly I feel betrayed and hurt, how dare these writers write something as awful as that, I will not spoil it for people who have not seen it, but it is better to not watch the last episode, live in the ignorant bliss, and to those who have not started the journey, don't start it, because you will have to watch the last episode, and that will leave you like I feel now, hurt and betrayed.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is more than just a comedy show. It contains some of the most valuable life lessons out of any series I've ever watched (and trust me, I've watched quite a few of them). The contrast between the characters is brilliant, having 3 men: Barney, the single dude that just wants to live life to its fullest and enjoy it with his friends going after girls, Ted, who is just tired of the single life and wants to find the love of his life and Marshall, who has already found his loved one, and then there are the 2 women: Lily, who is Marshall's girlfriend, and Robin, who just doesn't really know what she wants out of her life. All the characters are special in their own ways and show truly unique characteristics of their own.The good thing about having independent and different characters, is that the series doesn't have to focus all of its attention to the protagonist. Every single character has a defining role on the show, and there isn't a single episode where one of the five doesn't appear. Also, the series goes beyond just commedy and inserts some drama on the script, with major plot twists and invaluable life lessons for those who still aren't old enough to have experimented all of the stages of a love life and a relationship.Due to everything that this show represents, it is by far my favourite sitcom, and one of my top 5 series. I've watched it 6 times already and probably will keep on watching 'till I grow very old. 100% reccomended.\n",
      "1 \t\t Never watched this show before. Saw a rerun late at night or something.Clearly a perfect show for Neil Patrick Harris. He's an arrogant, stuck up jerk in real life. So it's perfect for him. He thinks he's pretty special since his Doogie Howser days.\n",
      "1 \t\t I really love this show , watching it every day Until the last episode and I fell sad after finishing it..\n",
      "0 \t\t Please, stop writing such meaningless, out of touch, out of reality episodes. This show was good at the beginning, but now it is so amazingly numb and full of nonsense. My 15 yo sister can write better \"Non messed in the head\" characters than that, if you really think thats how reality work, you need to to be in a mental hospital instead of writing, producing and watching such crap.

      "1 \t\t What kind of series is this that most women get unfriendly comments from important characters like Barney Stinson. The writers of this series all think this way: The jokes are all about a men's lust to women. It's all about whether women look good or not. If those women aren't their taste, they are bashed off with some jokes. The women are here who are made fun of in every episode again, mostly about female behavior. Those women hardly say or do anything back. There is so much about male sexuality and dominance in the series, and so little of female sexuality and dominance. It is not fun to make fun of people who can't say much back! Make it equal, because I am having a derection of this series, and I am not the only one. Men would definitely feel the same if men would be continuously made fun of by women.\n",
      "1 \t\t It's like a good copy or parody of tv series FRIENDS.. even showing same kind of characters and personalities.. nothing special or new\n",
      "1 \t\t It was a great story! I enjoy the cast members and I also enjoy the connection with there friends it shows how must important they're friendship is with each other.\n",
      "1 \t\t Bestest Show Ever. Best Actors. Best Album/songs/soundtracks. Best plot. Everything is best!!\n",
      "1 \t\t When I was in my twenties, I regarded \"Friends\" as my favourite show. Then there came HIMYM - which I loved from the start and dubbed to myself the \"Friends\" for adults. I became an adult as well. Now I find, that \"Friends\" haven't aged well - but I've just watched HIMYM again, on a couch with my own teenage kids - and I find it even better! It is not only the best sitcom ever. I dare to say, this is the awesomest thing, that has ever been created for television. Real legen- (wait for it) -dary!I would gladly award HIMYM with eleven stars, if there was an option. The show is so hilarious and steep, but on the other hand, true story about life, love, friendship, our parents, kids, dreams and expectations... I love this whole concept of \"Wonder Years\" style narrator, retelling the story - and sometimes forgeting details of the past. The humour is brilliant, and contrary to, say, \"Big Bang Theory\", if would still be a good thing to watch even without laughter track. The whole cast is excellent, although over-the-top Barney and sweet Lily steal most of the scenes. We would love to have all gang as our friends - and in a way, many of us have them in our hearts. I can't tell the same about \"Friends'\" characters, or any other sitcom. In spite of living in an opposite part of the world, I could easily identify with some of the gang's adventures and college memories.Deep thanks to creators of the series and the whole cast. I even forgive the (in)famous ending, which reminds us, that life is not only a laughter.\n",
      "0 \t\t I hate this series. Robin and Barney characters makes me vomit. Is the sex only thing people live for? Story line becomes more and more pathetic every season. It also depicts how selfish people are in Western society. Whats the problem with script writers.?\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved watching the first two seasons (randomly selecting half of the episodes but focusing on the key changes to the plot) and when I found out Barney ended up with Robin (from Internet sources) I skipped straight to season 10, where again I focused on half the shows for that season, picking key moments where the mother shows up (I prevented myself from finding out who the mother was from Internet sources).While I loved the idea of friendship and the friends really sticking up for each other, I came to realize they are toxic to each other, except Lily and Marshall who seemed to try to stay good people (good for them). Barney was portrayed by an amazing actor but his character was reprehensible except for his zest on life. Too bad he couldn't have channeled his energy into something positive aside from urging his friends to have fun, which itself was good.I think Robin and Ted used each other, and Barney too used everyone else. Not what I would like in my friends. And forget the other minor characters who usually had very little integrity.I know trading in shame and antics can make for entertaining television but I think they could have tried harder to make the characters more as real people and also better role models... I think it could be done.\n",
      "1 \t\t I would have given this series a solid 9 or 10 but that Gawd Awful last episode destroyed the whole series for me. I have not and will not rerun this series...\n",
      "0 \t\t So I'm one of the ones who adored this show and stuck with it up to the very end. I can't even watch it now. Literally haven't seen an episode since the finale aired. I refuse to go back and revisit it. Worst ending of a sitcom I've ever seen. Completely killed my love for the show. Still giving it a 6/10 because Neil Patrick Harris as Barney is perfection.\n",
      "1 \t\t Yes, I said it.\n",
      "HIMYM is the most beautiful show one could see. Great humor, great characters, great narrative, but best of all, beautiful story. It shows you what life is truly about, and that life doesnt always have a happy ending. I cant count the number of life lessons Ive learnt from this show. This is what a show is all about, not just episodes for the sake of it.\n",
      "Before anyone comes at me with \"You've probably not watched enough sitcoms\" oh i have. Friends? The office? B99? Parks and Rec? Scrubs? Yes Ive seen many. And HIMYM tops them all.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show has all the aspects that any good sitcom has, such as great humor, memorable characters, well told story arcs, and more, but this show has a uniqueness to it that sets it apart. How I Met Your Mother doesn't have uninspired clip shows, but instead has unique and inventive episodes, such as episodes with musical numbers, episodes like Trilogy Time, The Time Travelers, and others that are at least partially based on characters imagination, not to mention Bedtime Stories, which is an episode entirely in rhymes. The best thing that sets How I Met Your Mother apart is that instead of episodes with the humor mainly based around awkwardness, the humor is mostly story based and every episode has at least one truly emotional moment that often brings me to tears whether from happiness or sadness. These reasons and more are why How I Met Your Mother is my very favorite TV show and always will be!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t This Show has a special place in my heart. The jokes of barney marshal and lily, ted and robin's friendship and love . Everything was good although the ending was a bit absurd.\n",

      "1 \t\t I honestly cannot summarize the experience of watching this show into few words , but I'll try my best to do so :)Initially 'How I met your mother' felt like any other sitcom. It was quite fun to watch , but the more I watched , I simply fell in love with the show.The chemistry of characters is simply mind blowing , the puns and punches are top notch , the dialogues are absolutely brilliant ,but these are just the sidelines.HIMYM is a very powerful show , there were times I was laughing hard and some times I teared up. At the end of each episode I found myself smiling. Each episode tells you something , I have never seen this is any other sitcoms out there.Therefore this is not an average sitcom.\n",
      "I have seen many people categorize this show as 'Drama comedy' which is incorrect in my opinion. It is simply 'Slice of life' also many people compare this show with F.R.I.E.N.D.S , and trust me F.R.I.E.N.D.S is great , it is an overall perfect sitcom.\n",
      "Yet the unique Slice of Element of HIMYM hits you hard , that is something none other sitcom has ever done.'How I met your mother' is an absolute gem , I'm glad that this show exists.\n",

      "1 \t\t Ok to all of these friends fantards who are accusing this show of copying their lovely \" original \" show just sit down ...As much as I hate this show and never found it that funny or entertaining you can't really say \" it's a Friends rip-off \" since Friends was never original in the first place ... Friends copied storylines from other shows that aired before it and even shows that aired during its time in the 90s and y'all keep ignoring it and pretend that \" FrIeNdS iS oRiGiNaL FrIeNdS DiD iT fIrSt \" when 80% of Friends' storylines are copied from other shows which unfortunately these shows are so underrated that they don't get the recognition they deserve even tho they came up with all of these ideas that your beloved sitcom STOLE from them so just do the world a favor and shut it .\n",
      "0 \t\t Major Spoiler Get it? Get it?OK, so this show back in 2006/7 when I started watching it felt new and refreshing. Although we have already seen this kind of setup (5 friends doing stuff) this show was catchy and easy to watch, felt natural. Show had it's moment's, many catch phrase and one lines that will stay with us for quite some time. The jokes were funny, Characters Barney and Ted were done perfectly and everything just clicked. This constant chase for \"the mother\". Clues and well thought out plot. It was all there... BUT, yes there is BUT.Last few seasons were each worse then the one before. I don't know what happened but for me everything just started falling apart. It felt like they just got lazy and out of ideas and they gave us many terrible episodes enough to kill the charm of the show. I honestly don't remember the last time I laughed watching HIMYM. The only reason I did watch it is because I felt obligated to watch it. And then that ending, insult to injury. I felt like I was cheated into watching this whole thing just so they can try to make it emotional in the end AND THEN they throw away 9 seasons of this in last 10 minutes of the show. I am sorry it's maybe me but I want to feel satisfied after the ending, not wondering what they were thinking. People said things like \"o its real life, not fairy tale\". But for me it just doesn't fit in. 40 minutes of Ted and Tracy (that's her name right?) could not possible make us feel for what happened so we just feel depressed and cheated about the show, not the characters. The entire point of the show was tossed out of window into the sewers and then eaten by alligators. Just because they didn't know what to do with Barney or Robin. And you can argue me on \"it's real life that was their intention with mother and Ted all the time\" but Barney and Robin ending was good? Come on... It was rushed, not thought out, and it negates the whole show.I am sorry, but is there something like \"Dexter Playbook\" That teaches you to ruin shows? Because many are doing it.Show was great in the start, started falling off in last few seasons, ending killed it for me.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just discovered this show on Netflix over the summer and I'm so glad I did. How I Met Your Mother is now one of my all time favorite shows. I've bought every season on DVD and we even watch it on Netflix from time to time. The acting is perfect, the characters of Lily and Marshall remind me of my husband and myself, the story lines are great and the laughs are plentiful. I hope that when Ted does meet \"the Mother\" that the show will go on for a few more seasons so we can see Ted happy and married. If you haven't seen How I Met Your Mother, do yourself a favor and start at the beginning like I did and watch until you get caught up. It's a Legen(wait for it)dary show!!\n",

Don't look for a thought provoking series when a laugh track is included.It is never boring, or repetitive, (\"like Friends,\") it stays fresh and current.How I met your Mother is one of the funnest and easiest shows to watch. Sure, the show is not deep, introspective, or particularly unique.BUT WAIT! This show is still awesome. Why? Because HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER has HEART!This show is just off kilter enough to separate itself from the usual sitcom. I think that when \"HIMYM\" debuted after ,\"Two and a Half Men,\" it was such a refreshing contrast to see something modern that a Gen X would be interested in. It's competition was the standard, comfortable things that the whole family at Disneyland could relate to.This show was suggestive, modern, and one would never suspect Disney would have anything to do with it.\n",
      "1 \t\t Spoiler free:\n",
      "I do not know, how often I have watched HIMYM, but I am far from being bored by it. There are so many great things about this series regarding comedy, tragedy, emotions. I could go on, but I am sure, you get what I mean. I could watch it over and over again, and it does not get worse over time, as some shows do. You can find great humour in the first season and also in the fifth. Of course the style might change a little over the seasons, but so do the characters. You call that development.\n",
      "Spoiler:\n",
      "So why no 10 stars? I tell you why, first they spent over a whole season on the wedding between Robin and Barney ending in a breakup between them after only three years of marriage. Secondly, the ending is terrible. I think, I do not have to further explain why. That is not how you and such a great series. In my opinion, the alternative ending is acceptable/good. Despite the mentioned negative points, I really do recommend the show for all kinds of people.\n",
      "Give it a try, I swear, you will not regret it!\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is so amazing I really enjoyed watching it it deserves so much 😍😍😍😍 I will always love this show. It wasn't like most comedy shows such as friends or the big bang theory it was emotional and it made you smile or feel better after watching an episode of it. It's my favourite comfort Tv show and everything about it was so masterfully written. No matter how many times I've watched it I'm still not bored of this show and the ending will always end up with me in tears. Even when I was feeling sad or happy I always watched this show and I would definitely say that it will always be my favourite tv show.\n",
      "1 \t\t Please, read this first. I think the ending is not bad but the ending is perfect. Everything that done by ted and the way he told the whole story that directly indicates that the main part is love with robin. So at last when he meets at last with his first love, i think this is right. Because his daughter makes it clear he is really love with robin.\n",
      ".\n",
      "So i want to say that it is all about personal choice whether it is good or bad but please do not spread that ending is bad. I think the ending is in best possible way.\n",
      "0 \t\t Poor and lame attempt to copy Friends and failed. They have recreated so many funny scenes from Friends TV show and thy are all bad. Only good thing about this show is its story is based on New York. It's astonishing many people like this show, I guess either they haven't seen the Friends or they really have a bad taste. Good for watching if you have nothing to watch and nothing to do in your life.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've cried,i laughed, but finally I understood what life really means.\n",
      "1 \t\t \"How I Met Your Mother\" has all the makings of a generational hit show. It has a well balanced cast of characters sure to appeal to a wide range of viewers and an interesting mix of plot lines to keep the audience intrigued. The general premise of the show, a love story in reverse, is a truly novel and interesting take on the stereotypical network sitcom. Ted's journey to find the love of his life and get married has an interesting type of suspense, we already know he is married and has children 25 years in the future, so we have to wonder, with each new girl he meets, is she the one, much as Ted is doing himself. The added dimension of Robin being dangled in front of both Ted and the audience leads us through a series of cleverly crafted ups and downs with their relationship, always wanting them to end up together, much as we all wanted Ross and Rachel to end up together in the 90's, but knowing they can not if Robin is the children's \"Aunt Robin\".Much as we all enjoyed following the life and times of everyone's favorite \"Friends\" through the 90's, and before them, going somewhere everybody knows your name with \"Cheers\", the characters of \"How I Met Your Mother\" will draw you in and leaving you craving more every time. The true brilliance of the concept is that the story is perfect to run either as long or as short as the ratings will allow, we have no idea when Ted actually met his wife, and the kids are early to mid teens 25 years in the future, giving the show the possibility of running 2 years or 10, it all depends on how long we enjoy the show and keep it alive.Finally, a truly biased note here. In this day and age of more, faster, better, it is a wonderful feeling to find a show that is devoted to such a bohemian concept as true love. I personally revel in following the ups and downs of Ted's heart fluctuations and can very well relate. Its nice to find a show that can be this great combination of funny, romantic and serious all without missing a beat. I recommend a good healthy dose of \"How I Met Your Mother\" for anyone with a broken heart, a healing heart, a completed heart, or pretty much anyone with any type of heart (which is pretty much everyone but Barney), trust me, it will do you a world of good.\n",
      "1 \t\t Probably the best and the most unique thing about HIMYM is a solid story line which is pursued right from the first episode and culminates in the last episode. After each episode and each season, you feel the story moving forward and inching closer towards the end. It is a roller coaster of laughter, friendship and all kinds of emotions. The direction is really different from a lot of the other similar looking sitcoms delivering some really strong scenes that are truly touching. HIMYM is stronger on the dramatic front than the comedy part and I'll agree there are funnier shows out there but HIMYM rarely ever disappoints. HIMYM is a show that'll appeal to the romantic in you leaving you teary eyed sometimes and choking on laughter the other times.\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved it! Tracy, Lily, Marshall, Robin, Barney , Ted I just have to say THANK YOU for this. What a gang , what a story and what a journey! I'll miss you guys! Thank you for everything!!!!!!\n",
      "0 \t\t So, I can't say I did not like this show because I did very much at one time. I used to find it quite funny, even though Ted could get annoying at times and Barney being way to much. However, I attempted to watch the series again recently and it was cringeworthy. The way they treat women is just awful. Even though we all know the actor portraying the playboy Barney is actually gay, and his character is an exaggeration, it just does not work in 2021.\n",
      "1 \t\t A great show for people who love sitcoms it's about friendship and a guy with a suit and a romantic\n",
      "1 \t\t You know which one I'm referring to hopefully.And please, let this be a good example to writers that sometimes you should let the story be what it needs to be, not what you might want it to be.Otherwise, I absolutely love it.\n",
      "1 \t\t I'm watching it since 2008 all the time. Love it. The best show ever\n",
      "0 \t\t One of the worst comedy shows I've ever watched. Lame jokes, bad infantile acting... Not very creative story lines.. I will never understand how this show aired for 10 seasons???\n",
      "0 \t\t So just to get the picture how much I hate this sitcom I will tell you that I spent 20 minutes just to log in to this site. And I never give any review on movies or something. But the fact that this thing is so popular makes me sooo angry. It is stupied, not funny, boaring, cliche with bad acting. I watched 3 episodes in a row and i am depressed and want to kill Nikola who made me whatch this. My god, if I have to watch one more flash back i would kill myself.\n",
      "1 \t\t Himym is my favorite sitcom and I have watched it 3 times the whole series\n",
      "1 \t\t There is 9 seasons, 24 episodes each. I started watching 2 months ago and I'm done today. Do the math.Tears of laughter, sadness and everything in between through the whole 9 seasons. Outstanding script and acting, absolutely amazing character development, just.. (I'm actually tearing up because I know there's no more to watch and I'm missing it already..)I'm a sucker for these short comedy type sitcoms.. But this one really takes the cake. Sure, Friends might've had a more iconic note to them and I laughed and cried through that one too, but really - HIMYM is so much better when you look at it as a whole.I'm not revealing anything here. This show either grows on you and gets you addicted to it or it's just not your cup of tea. My mother wouldn't like it in a million years, but I LIVED watching it. So there's that. It's on Netflix and I'd hurry cause I don't know for how much longer they're gonna have the license for it.\n",
      "1 \t\t My teen asked me to watch this with him, and, I was hooked during the first episode. Then, it occurred to me...\"why would a teen be interested in a comedy about big-city yuppies in their late-20s-early-30s?\" I asked and was told, 'because I like it.' O.K. :DIt's a very funny comedy; and, like any good comedy, the characters work very well together. Each character has his or her own way so that the 'group' functions well.The concept is good, too. The character, Ted, over a period of 25 years, is explaining to his two children...'how I met your mother;' and, each episode brings the answer closer.My Son and I watch this as often as we can, and, there's never a dull moment. It's too bad the show was cancelled in 2014.Two 'thumbs-up' for this comedy! :)\n",
      "1 \t\t What can I say, I just finished watching this show probably for the 5th time. Yes, all seasons, right from season 1 through to 9. This, along with \"The Big Bang Theory\" is my go-to definition of simple fun. I can just switch the show on when I cannot find anything interesting to watch or have limited time to kill and always end up having a good laugh. More than Big bang, this show get a bit emotional, but it balances it well with a strong dose of humour and \"Barney\". This guy is simply ingenious. Can you just recollect the number for gorgeous females we got introduced just because of his character. From Katy Petty to Britney to Nazanin and Becki Newton. It was a visual treat watching all these gorgeous females with hilarious characterisation.And then the friendship, they stand with each other through thick and thin. It is heart-warming watching all the emotional stuff which they go through. Marshall, for always being the ideal boyfriend and husband. Lilly for being the sane one where other characters could always count on. Robin for bringing the charm this show needed, Ted for being the hopeless romantic and Barney, for just being Legend...wait for it...Dary!! Legendary!!Some scenes/episodes had a lasting impression on me that I watch them over and over. Like Marshall, prepping for the Marathon OR Stella watching StarWars, Lilly regretting her bad decisions OR Robin for Robin \"Sparkles\". Ted for honestly trying again and again for true love, Barney for the ultimate show-down from his play book, \"The Robin\". This show is really a roller-coaster ride of fun and emotions.And finally when the mother gets introduced in the very last season, she really is everything which the show was building up to and more. \"Cristin Milioti\" was excellent as the Mother! The way they switch times-lines back and forth with the mother was simply heart-warming! Which brings me the biggest, unforgivable flaw of the show!! The way they ended it. It really makes no sense of everything the show built up to, especially throughout the last season! It was like the makers thought, \"Lets just throw everything out of the window and opt for a finale purely on shock factor!!\" Ok, if this was a horror show or a thriller, it makes sense. But come one, this is Mother we are talking about and it ends with a twist! The alternate ending would have made this show simply perfect, but what's the use. People consider original ending and not stop in the last minute and watch the alternate ending on YouTube. Which is exactly what I strongly suggest everyone, who has not watched the show, to do. Watch until the end and simply watch the alternate ending on Youtube. It will be the perfect and most satisfying conclusion for this great show.Other than the hugely messed up ending, this show has few other minor flaws. It goes on for way too long at times, also some episodes feel hugely padded out. Like a whole episode dedicated to the \"Slap-Bet\" or stopping abruptly with the Mother's story and giving us a whole episode of \"Gary Blauman\"!!!??? I mean the character who plays Blauman is real-life Robin's husband. Sure if they had to include him, they should have done a guest appearance, not dedicate a whole episode for him. At least they show conclusions of several other prominent characters in this one, which is the best part of it.But yes, omitting the ending, these are minor flaws of a great, thoroughly enjoyable show. And \"How I met Your Mother\" will always hold that special place in my heart... for all those countless moments of fun, laughter and emotional-doses which the show provided.\n",
      "0 \t\t Friends and Big Bang theory are better shows than this trite garbage.\n",
      "1 \t\t Just finish watching it on Netflix and its bloody amazing its so funny each episode flys by coz you get so hooked in it its good to see the cast grow up over the seasons and ik thats is an unpopular opinion but i LOVED the ending i was rooting for Robin and Ted all the way through\n",
      "1 \t\t I am 66 and I asked my grandson what i could watch on netflix that would be easy on my brain, and he told me How I met your mother was ace. So nothing ventured nothing gained. I loved it, watched religiously every evening from 5.30pm for a few hours laugh out chill. I actually used to look forward to watching it yes shows how sad my life is lol. But i loved all the characters they were all legendary. I was so excited about finally finding out about Who Ted finally marries and lives with. Every episode prior i just enjoyed the stories were so funny, and i fell in love with all the characters, and my favorite i have to say was Barney who showed actually under all that facade he was a very caring person. I hated Robin she irked me, to be honest, i could have shaken her on several occasions, but they were all part of the family and you have to learn to live with family with all their faults. It got closer and closer to the end, I finally hit season 8, and was biting my nails..... the penultimate episode i thought omg what will i watch when i have finished..........Towards the end of Season 8 i was struggling to watch it. It was like i was full after eating a huge banquet, and couldn't face eating another bite....that is how the season left me. I was glad when i finally finished it, but felt let down it was almost not worth watching. Oh well I thought one more Season to go season 9, perhaps i should have had a break and not binged watch, so i gave it a few weeks rest. I could wait no longer and decided i had to finish i needed to know who Ted married and how their life panned out, even in Season 8 you didn't know yes you were given a few clues, but knew nothing still. So finally with trepidation i clicked on Season 9, Episode 1, this was it, I would finally find out..............After watching 12 hours 24 episodes over a few days, I thought to myself of well i will never ever get those hours back..........Have you heard of the saying JUMP THE SHARK? Season 9 had really jumped the shark, what a load of rubbish really i watched hours of this series, excitedly thinking we would finally meet the women of Teds dreams, we were teased with images of her, and yellow umbrella, forced fed the worse script i have ever sat and listened too, it was dire, ridiculous, stupid, far fetched the show had totally run out of steam it had died at the end of Season 7, and by season 9, it totally needed resuscitation and so did I.After watching about 108 hours by the end in a few seconds i finally learnt her name, I wont say anything else it will spoil it, but believe me when I say this, the ending was the biggest load of tripe EVER in the history of T.V. series. Mid way of Season 9 it got to the point when i couldn't care who she was. So for me Season 1 - 7 great, Season 8 blah, and Season 9, don't bother.\n",
      "1 \t\t It could be the best show ever if it weren't for the last episode where the mother died and Barney and Robin got divorce...\n",
      "But the rest of the show is very good... Comedy, drama , romance...\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is such a different unique one in the way it is told. It does an excellent job in creating arcs for their likeable characters, and is probably the sole best show for running gags. The reason this didn't get a 10 is partly due to the lackluster 9th season and the flop finale - so much character development thrown out the window.\n",
      "1 \t\t The show is a treat to watch , constantly funny except the last season , interesting and intelligent . However the last season or to be specific the last episodes spoils it\n",

      "is the conclusion.\n",
      "0 \t\t Ending is not bad... although it wasn't what I wanted. I definitely wanted _O_I_ to endup with _ _ _ N_ _. The rest of them I would have been absolutely fine if ended different, given that it should make sense.\n",
      "1 \t\t As a fan of \"Friends\" too, I don't care that there are so many similarities between these two. First, I saw \"Friends\", and it became my favorite tv show. I saw it at least two times, and then I started just to put it on tv as a \"background noise\". I still laugh/cry at some scenes after so much time. And that's why I can't choose between these two: \"Friends\" was the first favorite tv show, but \"HIMYM\" is more alike my life. Or more alike the life and the friends I would like to have. As Barney would say \"Hanging out at a coffee place: not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.\" Well, I'd like to drink my \"hangover-fixer elixir\" in my favorite coffee shop after I spend the night at my favorite bar :)\n",
      "1 \t\t Essentially the show was all about a dad telling his kids his and his friends sexual conquests. Show should have been called either mine and my friends sexual conquests or How I'm Still in Love with Robin.Personally I loved the show growing up, but the way they had that final season was rather disappointing. So much buildup that absolutely didn't go anywhere.\n",
      "1 \t\t I have watched all the episodes from the beginning to the end. All of the episodes were great specially the chemistry that came out because of the barney and robin. It continued from the mid season to the their wedding in the last episode. It's a must watch chemistry, mesmerizing.But in the last episode, I felt a little betrayed from the authors, came to me like some April fool's day joke. I even searched some blogs and forums to confirm that cause the things that's bring brought from season to season, that was barney and robin and their relationship suddenly breaks up in the last fifteen minute. Most of the viewers did not not like that as they were expected an happy ending to barney and robin.Still the series was good but I think the last episode need to be edited.\n",
      "1 \t\t I have been watching this show for about five weeks now since BBC bought it and I have to say it is one of the best comedy shows to come out of the U.S. I could go as far to say that it has the potential to be the new 'Friends'. Like that show it involves a group of characters congregating in both an apartment and a public venue of some kind this time a bar. But in my opinion this show has a lot more heart, less cruel putdowns and not as many ridiculous situations. Another way the show makes itself original is through its backward narrative so each episode is told itself as a separate story the only problem is that eventually we are going to have to find out how Ted 'Met Your Mother' Josh Radnor shines in his first leading role making Ted likable without being a complete sissy who almost reminds me of Jimmy Fallon but slightly better in the roles he plays. Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan do well in their parts, Lily and Marshall are probably the most realistic characters trying to make the final step into adulthood but being pulled back by witnessing the fun that the other members of the group are having. Robin could have easily been a one-sided character but Cobie Smolders makes her seem both exciting and vunreable. But as Barney, Neil Patrick Harris steals the show. After his self-spoofing appearance in Harold and Kumar he showed that he had a niche for comedy and that is evident here. Every put-down, one-liner and sparkling line of dialogue is delivered brillaintly. And even though Barney is shallow, Harris makes him likable showing his need for the company of the others as a sounding board for his schemes to get Ted a woman. Finally the writing is sharp and some of the scenes are so realistic, especially the latest episode I watched in the club, where nobody could here what anyone else was saying. All in all the best American sitcom in a long while.\n",
      "1 \t\t Let me start by saying that I really loved this show when it started. The concept was different than the usual sitcoms because future Ted is telling the story to his kids. It was funny, had all the usual characters you want to see in a sitcom, plus Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stintson is just awesome. The first 3 seasons are just perfect, but the show should have ended there. For instance Marshall was \"the kid\" in the beginning and he was just an awesome character but then he became \"the man\" and just lost all those traits that made him awesome. Ted was awesome too and now he's the hopeless romancer who will fall for every girl that gives him a bit of attention... Barney is still Barney but for some reason he used to be so much more awesome. The most important thing in a television show is knowing when to end it. Seinfeld knew when to end his show, Friends also knew when to end. They ended with style and when i think about them I think about all the awesome moments that each season contains. How i met your mother simply doesn't end, and when i think about this show i remember the awesome first 3 seasons and the disappointment i'm getting in all the others. Not only that, in the current season (8) they are just ruining the stories that made the first 3 seasons awesome and I'm sorry but that is a crime. I give 5 stars to this show: One for each of the awesome first 3 seasons, one for barney and one for the small amount of episodes that made me laugh after the third season.\n",
      "0 \t\t The worst program on tv ever .. every time it comes on i want to find something else before i puke ... horrid cast ... these people make vomit look great ... really pathetic\n",
      "1 \t\t the first season was absolutely fantastic, i love this show, you can watch the episodes alone, or grab a bowl of popcorn and rofling with your friends (:]), its just my taste of a show.the camera direction is flawless, and Barney is of course, one of the best :), and the other characters are built up great. the 2nd season was also very good, just like the first.The third season due, the first 11 episodes, were just about and around the same jokes, pretty shallow, the plot wasn't that interesting, and the show went nowhere. but i must say, the writers managed to \"rise from the Grave\" and did a wonderful job getting the show back on the track.really, the show, is just, recommended :)\n",
      "0 \t\t Overall very good show. But Ted is boring most of the time, and his story with robin is just ridiculous (specially the end!). Only a mess and makes no sense their love story, she never really looked like she was in love with him. Ted is just dumb until the end, proof is that he stole the blue thing again because he thinks he is super romantic. Boring!\n",
      "1 \t\t When I watched this, it was terrific. Now, not so sure.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great movies or series don't need to be objectively perfect to be a 10/10!In this case it's just a feeling deep inside.. watching this show simply makes me happy and it will always have a special place in my heart!\n",
      "1 \t\t You will not find the real jest of the storyline unless you watch it at a certain age where you probably hit rock bottom or at a stage of grown-up melancholic late night hours.Every soundtrack with Ted's narration will touch a memory or two. Many will find the characters and their daily life a relatable experience.It's a package full of friendship, struggle with adulthood, career, and LOVE.So, if you want to experience the true impacts of all that, watch it when you went through all these emotions and met your gang who support you at every step of your life.\n",
      "1 \t\t The jokes are too much reliant on pop culture. The decisions made in the long term by characters don't make any sense.It's just drama for the sake of drama and c\n",
      "broken comedy spilled everywhere.I tried watching the show again but I couldn't.And yet, I rate it 10 out of 10 because for some reason this show took me through the worst time in my life. I always liked to know I am like Ted even though I am not but the emotions he feels especially the downs really helped me a lot to get through life when it was airing it's final two seasons.Loved the ending and to this I get a tear in my eyes when I see the last scene.\n",
      "1 \t\t How can I express myself to convey you all that how much I enjoy this series. I love the dramatic \"Barney Stinson\", the loser yet so sweet, sensitive and charming \"Ted Mosby\", and this beautiful girl \"Robin Scherbatsky\" who isn't a girly girl, \"Lily Aldrin\", she is funny and a bit weird for me, \"Marshal Erikson\" he is adorable. This series is fun and I am always wanting to watch more and more. There is a link to all episodes but yet each is fun to watch as individual episodes. How I wish I could have such fun gang, how I wish I can some day tell such awesome story to my kids. \"Suit Up\", I love barney as a character, he is so silly and I love his \"Challenge Accepted\" and also \"Bro Rules\". Yes it's a fun to watch series and you would never be bored.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is actually pretty funny because parts of it remind me of my life. While I don't have a tight knit group of friends who hang out every night at the same bar, my life compares in these ways. First of all, I'm a New Yorker(born & bred). Any comments or jokes they make about area codes, counties, settings, etc. are things I know about and don't have to wonder what they mean. Ted in a way is like me. He's the nice guy who wants a meaningful relationship but has no luck in finding the right woman. Barney is too much. When he came out with that comment about Ted 'needing to get a suit' in the first episode it reminded me so much of a friend of mine. He always has to wear a suit when he goes out and tried to get me and another friend to do the same thing all the time. Barney can be a jackass thinking he is G-d's gift to women, having a very overinflated ego, coming up with ridiculous ways to meet women and flaunting everything in other people's faces. He's still funny, though. My favorite part are the ladies. I love redheads and Alyson Hannigan has always been one of my favorites. She is so damn cute. That and I don't think I've ever seen her look hotter than she does as Lily. Her overloaded sex drive and constant need to do it with her fiancé Marshall are in my opinion some of the funniest parts of the show. As for Robin, damn! She is one of the most delicious pieces of ass I've ever seen. I love tall women with great legs and she more than fits that mold. While the show has been on since 2005, I only started watching it online this week. Once I catch up, I think it'll be only the 3rd show I can enjoy on CBS, the other two being CSI and CSI: Miami.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is the first time I watched any TV series other than Indian. From the first episode to the last moment.. everything is close to heart.HIMYM has the feel that touch your heart in every possible way and once you watched it.. you will remember it 'til your last day.\n",
      "0 \t\t Barney's having sex with many women again because he is so suave and cool (laugh track ensues)\n",
      "Did you know the actor is actually gay? (Audience shocked noise)Honestly, this is the personality people needed after they watched Friends over and over again until the references just became far too outdated.The Big Bang Theory was okay for them but it just wasn't the same. Even this isn't quite Friends but it's the best damn thing to it.Shows like this create terrible people who genuinely think they are the characters but people do not act like this. This is not normal. This is not funny. You just aren't original and need a personality to copy. Please, I beg of you for your friends and family, find a better one.\n",
      "1 \t\t It starts off with a great premise. The characters are nothing we haven't seen before, but they gel together, and the plot works well, but something happened post season five - maybe the show was forcefully stretched by its producers, or the network, whatever, but it feels like the writers ran out of juice. If you want a honest review, I'll suggest you watch it upto season five for the memes, and then forget about it because there are many shows, far superior to this.\n",
      "0 \t\t The only reason I had to registry with IMDb and write this review is that this show has got better ratings then \"Friends\" and even \"Everybody Loves Raymond\". Knowing this kills me. This show has seldom made me or my friends laugh and is about smiling sometimes only where as Friends and Everybody loves Raymond will make you laugh multiple times in every episode.If you are a mature audience and have a good sense of humor, please do not waste your time on this show which I stopped watching after the forth season.Apart from character Barney, this show has really got nothing.\n",
      "1 \t\t I can not believe this doesn't have a 10/10 rating, it is the best written sitcom of all.\n",
      "1 \t\t I really enjoyed HIMYM for the time it was on. Not only because the atmosphere surrounding the brilliant story was kind of cozy and nice, so you could really snuggle up under a blanket and just immerse yourself in a wonderful funny world, where it's almost like you have 5 good friends, but also because the story is so well- rounded and kept under control, despite being massively complex with all its flashbacks and whatnot. The writers really did a fascinating job created art as beautiful as this. In fact, I just started re-watching it again. Now, because this is such an awesome show, I would also like to comment on the wonderful (but quite emotional) ending, which has gotten a lot of critiques for no reason. I think it is perfect, but let me just list the two main tropes that most critiques would have wanted in the original ending: 1) Barney and Robin end up together and live happily every after. 2) The mother doesn't die and lives happily ever after with Ted. The problem with these tropes, in my opinion, is that these where only built up in seasons 8-9. However, the original ending much more satisfies the fact that the show has been about Ted and Robin's on and off relationship/friendship. Much more than actually being about how he met his children's mother. Also, Barney has, for over 7 seasons always been the womanizing, suited up, awesome character that was always ready with a joke and kind of child spirited. It was actually ONLY in the 8th and 9th season he went all romantic and wanting to settle down. The original ending though, throws Barney Stinson back into the role he started out with and made us laugh for 7 (actually 9) seasons. Now watch the last two episodes again, keeping this in mind and I think you should be able to find joy in the current ending as much as I do\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of the most amazing friend type sitcom made ever its really good based on realistic life and never felt it to be boring even a single. My favourite character in this series was Barney(for most its him only). Such series really make you feel about having friends and their importance and value in our life\n",
      "0 \t\t Absolutely loved the show and its going on my forever list definitely. The only reason I gave it a 9 star just cause the ending was absolutely rushed and disappointing.\n",
      "0 \t\t Can't even remember most of their adventures, looking back they seem poorly stringed together. A small group of friends and their love and friendship exploits, as remembered by a seemingly father telling his kids how they came to be. The main premise is deceitful and dissapoints throughout the zillion series this show seems to have. The actors are unevenly relatable, sometimes the characters are down right annoying. Would not watch it again, perhaps just some episodes, for other featured actors. A dilluted comedy series, I find the hype about it surprising and don't see the reason for it.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've been waiting for a show like HIMYM since the end of Friends(probably th best series ever!). How i met your mother has everything; GREAT humor, very good acting and story, good looking chicks and of course.. Neil Patrick Harris. If you haven't seen him in harold and kumar, watch it! Harris's character Barney is sooo funny, I love that character, he gives a little more spice to everything. And I love this whole show but I think that the story should grow a little bit, but everything in its own time because I hope this show will run for at least 10 seasons! BTW, does anybody else sometimes get like REALLY annoyed at Ted and think that this show reminds a lot of Friends?\n",
      "0 \t\t Its very good but only problems were fact that its hard to get into it and fact that lilly is super annoying\n",
      "1 \t\t Great Although It can get a little annoying at times And Drag little bit Extremely entertaining\n",
      "0 \t\t Great show, but just another inconspicuous social engineering scheme. throughout the seasons all they refer to on and off are Jewish \"neglections.\" I dont buy that nonsense. Stopped watching the show (after the 5th one).... start counting... think about it... are there ANY references to ANY other religious epitaphs or \"spoil my communions,\" baptisms, or ANY other religious references AT ALL, etc?\" NOPE! Just, \"is it ok that I'm Jewish, dont watn to spoil my shabbas, etc. COMPLETE BS, WAKE UP! I work aroudn this nonsense 24/7 so I see it like the morning sun. Check for it in movies, songs ,etc also.... watch how muc much it is ONLY coming from ONE side! NOBODY ELSE DOES THIS!!!!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved how I met your mother! It was really funny until around season 4 where the laughs weren't as funny (they were more scoffs) and it was purely focused on the love triangles and who gets who. Don't get me wrong, I loved it and the ending! But they used all of the good laughs in the first few seasons but then it was more about making sure the plot was finished and how Ted finally met (his kids) mother.\n",
      "1 \t\t The last season , season 9 is nearing it's end with the revelation of the mother. You might think how can anyone handle 9 seasons of story-telling with nothing but disappointment at the end of every season... If you watch it, you'll get the answer. I used to finish one season in one day, that's how awesome it was. But soon i realized after i finish this show, what was i gonna do? So i took it slow, one episode a day.. It was as hard for me as it is for a heroin addict to keep off heroin. But that's i how i did it and each episode brought me laughter, philosophy, tears and other deep emotions.If you're a person who believes in the 'universe' , then please watch the show and you'll fall in love with it !\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the show sooo much, I never thought I'll like a show this much. Friends was my threshold of measuring sitcoms but this one passed it with high scores! Though I loved the storyline so freakin much, I do wish that I never had seen its last 2 episodes and ended it at 22. The way they killed of Tracy just so that Ted and Robin wind up together was pethetic and when Barney and robin got divorced it was even worse.\n",
      "They spend a whole, perfect season on their wedding from proposal to bachular party to the locket background and everything the next episode comes, surprise surprise they're divorced!\n",
      "This show was perfection all the teases to the wedding until season 9 so it can all come together to THE ONE. And the actual perfect woman from Ted actually comes to him. But then got killed off. That was a horrible end. For 9 years we were ready to see the one and what we got was Ted and Barney again!!\n",
      "1 \t\t The show is really good and does have a lot of great one liner joke , but by the end of season 2 I lost the interest of watching it .. that love story was great but ending like that was a bitch move.\n",
      "1 \t\t I started watching this thinking it'd be one season where we find out he met his wife and then 3 more seasons reminiscing. Never did I expect that it took 9 seasons to find out who she was. But it was a great ride, though at some point during Seasons 6 & 7, many, including myself, thought it couldn't carry on much longer.Besides anticipating seeing who the mother is, the episodes are full of little things that become a crisis. There are 2 things I love about the series: (1) episode arcs where Ted dates and we see who the potential mothers are, and (2), all the episodes where the tiniest thing become the biggest crisis with everyone going \"WHAT!?!?\".The love affair of Marshall and Lily is an inspiration, Barney is a true legend, and Ted is just so lovable. You can't miss with this show - I count less than 10 boring episodes in the entire 8-and-three-quarter season.\n",
      "1 \t\t So it isn't completely original, it's sometimes predictable, and at times the characters are a little cheesy. But this show is great because it is endearing. The characters are people you might know, or people you would want to know: a romantic nerdish guy, an adorable couple who are best friends, an independent GenX girl, and a womanizing goof-ball who ultimately is very loyal to his friends. It's often hilarious, usually revolving around Barney's antics, but it also pays close attention to certain details of life and makes you truly feel a closeness to the characters. It's a winning show, and I hope that it continues for a while longer yet.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the most pointless show on TV. In the last season they finally reveal the mother but instead of introducing the character. They spend 8 episodes on a three day period. The actor they used for the Mother is great she is funny and a great actress but they never show her in the ENTIRE show! I mean the whole bases of the show is surrounded by her and they don't even bother to end the show on a bang. All Ted does anymore is complain and says that he loves robin over and over again. This show has no substance. The show is booooooring now. Where is the entertainment? This show was once entertaining but no longer is, no wonder it is being canceled.\n",
      "1 \t\t The different seasons are enjoyable to different degrees but it has the worst ending I've ever seen!\n",
      "1 \t\t I started watching HIMYM in Oct 2010 when it was being aired in TV in India. It was season 5 if I'm not wrong. Then I lost track thanks to my work and MBA classes. Last yr after I took it from my cousin and started watching it right Season 1 . Some of my friends had already watched it and were praising it. I'd decided that I'll write a review of it on IMDb after watching all seasons which I completed last week.I've to admit, I became a fan of the series in season 1 itself. A brilliant concept and a story which I could relate to. I'm 29 and I see myself in Ted many times as the seasons went on. I also love Barney's character and hope to have a girl friend like Robin.But somewhere in season 4, I felt it became more of Robin, Barney, Lily and Marshal's story and less of Ted's. The writers focused more on their lives and in Season 5 & 6 were hugely disappointed. It was like watching some series of gags. The story was not moving and some episodes were plain stupid and dumb. Season 7 was OK while season 8 was far better and the characters had matured a lot. Maturity was lacking in season 5 & 6 especially. When I watched the trailer of Season 9, I realized how right the kids were in the trailer. And, I appreciate the writers and makers to have realized their mistake and end it in season 9.I hope season 9 is good and the story ends well. Frankly, I would have loved to see this end in Season 8 but I'll watch season 9 because there is still love for this sitcom.It is the best I've watched and I hope it ends with a bang !!\n",
      "0 \t\t I loved this show so much, and for that very reason it is so painful for me to watch its agony. The characters were adorable and funny, the plot was developing - at a snail's pace, at least. I was really looking forward to seeing each new episode, and now I wish I could fast-forward the one I'm watching.I don't care how Ted met the mother of his children anymore, and something tells they won't present me with the Holy Grail any time soon. I don't care what's gonna happen next because every new episode is either a pseudo flashback (the unseen footage, so to speak) or an implausible story with a superficial plot twist (and I use the term loosely). As for the plot itself, the snail that was dragging it before must have died of old age or severe, if not mortal, fatigue.At this point, I feel I'm about to give up on the show and go with the highlights. Should be enough to satisfy my curiosity.I give it 8 out of 10 solely for old times' sake.\n",
      "1 \t\t The best sitcom ever in my life. I repeatedly watching it. From S1-9 every year\n",
      "1 \t\t Part of me is gone when this show is no longer in Netflix. I remember watching this in 2012 and since then, I have watched it countless of time. I cannot remember how many time I have seen Barney saying \"Have you met Ted\" or Ted denied \"that was not the signal\". This show is legend wait for it dary.8 years after last episode, I am still watching it everyday. HIMYM had taught me a lot about life matters and I am grateful that I started this show.\n",
      "1 \t\t This has been and will always be the funniest show I've ever seen..it's original,goofy jokes,characters livelihood and the best comedy (not forced just flows).Been a fan for 10years plus and it has never ever disappointed.10/10 for me always\n",
      "1 \t\t There have been very few shows which have got me hooked on totally and boy, does this one deserve it. A total laugh riot but it has its sentimental moments. And its this that makes it a great show.Ted, Marshall, Barney, Lily and Robin all act out their roles with total justice. Ted's character as the guy looking for his The One has been sketched well and Josh Radnor does full justice to it.Jason Segel as Marshall is amazing. He acts the doting husband's role perfectly. Alyson Hannigan as his loving wife is good too.Cobie Smulders as Robin is seriously sexy. You just can't help but fall in love with her.But the character that is loved by all is Barney. Neil Patrick Harris does total justice to his AWESOME character and of all the things that you would remember of this show, you would definitely remember his fundas like bro code and stuff. No wonder he has got so much acclaim for this role.In all, a spectacular show. It will keep you riveted to the end of each episode and wanting to see the next one.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of my all time favorite shows. I have gone back and watched it many times though the years. Hope this show gets a second round sometime down the road.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is a perfect mix of comedy and a storyline, and I personally love it!\n",
      "1 \t\t When this show is funny its REALLY funny, the entire of season one had me in stitches. Now its not for everyone, its blatantly filling the gap in the market left by the cancellation of friends but in direct comparison the characters blend much better than in friends and the script is absolutely gold! As with friends the show heavily focuses on romance so if you're thick skinned or hate rom coms then this wont sit right with you either, I also don't find this to be an 'introduce to your friends' type of show as its heavy serialised with most plots needing the whole back-story to be funny. Having said that I got into the show after seeing one random episode from season one and was immediately addicted. The show is not perfect, the start and middle of season two get shackey with only every other episode being funny but its seemed to pick up pace again toward the end of season two. Definitely give season one a blast and see how you feel after that, season two was worth watching and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on season three.I do have one big gripe with the show, sometimes it seems to really go at 'nerds' and 'fat' people despite having many references to star wars in the show. The writers seem to express a lot of non-pc opinions through the barny character, I'm just griping about the odd comment that went a little too far for me and I'm sure they would argue that they're simply reinforcing his character.\n",
      "1 \t\t Really entertaining, makes you laugh every episode\n",
      "1 \t\t To be honest, one reasons I signed up an account just to giving this masterpiece TV series a review. This sitcom is something that you can enjoy with anyone who want to taste comedy. I remember watching this before I go to the bed, giving the meaning that Ted was giving me a bedtime stories. Love the pure comedy and love stories here and some other people may disappointed in the ending but personally I love every single of the episodes.\n",
      "0 \t\t The ending ruined this show for me. While a show like Dexter had a bad ending as well, it didn't make all the previous seasons pointless.How many more ways could Robin have told Ted that she just wasn't that into him?!?!But let's forget every single conversation, Robin IS into him.When I was watching the ending of HIMYM, I couldn't stop thinking, whyyy did I waste all this time?!It was a fun, sweat show and I will probably watch it again sometimes while doing chores. But where it would have gotten an 8 at least, it become only a 6 for me. I hate when the duration of the show was so clearly for the money money money. I feel used.\n",
      "1 \t\t Ok I have something to get off my chest about the ending of HIMYM. Almost everyone hated it. And I did too. But this scene and other real, emotional, and gut wrenching scenes made me realize that this show is about life. For everyone. You can cling on the the past and try to keep everyone together and happy, but life moves on. People move on, fade, etc. When the gang is all split up at the end of the show, it shows how everyone moves on with their lives. How real life can be. Barney and Robin get divorced because of their jobs. Lily and Marshal are busy traveling and taking care of their kids. Ted is with Tracy and the kids until she dies, something that can happen to any of us anytime. It's all real. It wasn't the typical happy ending that every sitcom gets. It was the real life ending that real life gets. It's not always happy. It's not always a perfect ending. Times change and so must people.The whole point of Ted telling the kids the story of how he met Tracy was to move on. The kids moved on and now it's time for Ted to move on. He did, in some way, get his happy ending. He got to be with the love of his life, Tracy, and had kids. But it's time for a new chapter.I do think they could've done the ending better but I also think that it is very under-appreciated.\n",
      "EDIT: Here's a quote from Abed Nadir (From the show Community. It's a great show, go watch\n",
      "1 \t\t These stories might not be realistic where ex's hang out with each other, Barney hook up with 200+ odd girls. But, the story line sticks to the description and each character has given their best shot. Each time the season ends, there is sense that the girl we see in the end is the mother.. But it is not.. Perfectly drawn plot.! The voice keeps popping out wherever Ted goes- \"Your mother was there! But more on that later.\" That keeps us thrilled and more thirst to watch. How can I miss the Barnacles. The most popular character, is funniest, sometimes lame but yet too funny, sarcastic and the best!! There is this one friend like Barney in the gang, right? The more I say, the less it is. I would recommend this show to everyone. This is the best ever show.\n",
      "1 \t\t A truly wonderful sitcom that manages to strike a brilliant balance between comic moments and impressive character development. Characters seem realistic and draw the audience in making them truly feel emotions towards the characters of the show. The way in which the story is told through a series of flashbacks is also very impressive. I know a lot of people who are slating the show saying it isn't funny and whatever and I can see that if you just watch the first episode then you might be somewhat justified in that opinion. But seriously, watch it from the beginning and I assure you that you will love it! I'd say that even if you don't like it at first and don't think it's as funny as some others out there, stick with it and you will grow to love it and see that sitcoms don't just have to be about laughs all the time.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of my favorite sitcoms. The acting game is great. Every time I watched this sitcom, I envied the characters and their friendship. The whole series was very interesting for me to see my mother and what the ending would be, and she did not disappoint me. I was happy and sad with the characters and it was like I was part of their story and it's very cool.\n",
      "1 \t\t A really great sitcom with LOTS of heart. The great thing about this show was that EACH one of its main cast was awesome in their respective roles and really pulled them off. The Gang .i.e Ted, Robin, Marshall, Lilly and of course BARNEY STINSON all were great characters and their adventures throughout 9 WHOLE seasons were awesome. The development of their relationships, their hilarious rules, their histories etc everything was a delight to watch (for the most part at least). My favourite of them all was Barney. His BRO Codes, his coolness, his awesome stories were the best part of the show. Probably my favourite sitcom character so far. Really liked how they slowly developed him over the seasons.Granted that the quality of the show dipped in the last couple of seasons, and they REALLY DRAGGED THE LIVING HELL OUT OF IT, but even then, it never ventured into lame territory. Even at its worst, it was still a good show, and that really is something considering its length. The finale of any show is of the utmost importance because that is how you'll leave the show and it leaves a lasting impression, especially if you love that show. Sorry to say, finale of this sitcom simply CRAPPED all over it. Extremely disappointing. I don't even know what the writers were thinking, VERY SLOPPY work. I really could rant on about it for hours but doing so will spoil it so I'll leave it at that on the open, even though spoiling it won't really matter because it SIMPLY SUCKS. One thing I'm glad the show did perfectly, was the MOM. I just immediately liked her when they FINALLY showed her. She was a great character and really felt like a perfect match for Ted. Wish there were more episodes of her.Overall, even with the HORRIBLE finale and extremely dragged last couple of seasons, it is still a great sitcom and a must watch. Will definitely miss it. It was Legen wait-for-it...... dary. Self five. :D8.5/10\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the first 5 seasons, Barney especially does the most amazing job on this show. But then season 6 came alone and it start a very rapid and steep decent into terribleness.\n",
      "1 \t\t What a strange premise for a television show- a father is telling his two teenagers about every single person he slept with and all the people his best friends slept with before he met their mother. Seriously who would do that? It's very odd!\n",
      "1 \t\t Yeah, this is all you need from a sitcom you need to get through the loss of \"Friends\" after it ended. I swear to god, if this was a drama, it would be Suits.So it runs around Ted (Josh Radnor), a twenty-something slacker in need of a girlfriend. So with his friends Barney (Neil Patrick Harris), Robin (Cobie Smulders), Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan), he goes out to find his future wife.With quotable lines, funny characters and the most impressive comedic timing since Friends, this will no doubt go down in history as one of the funniest shows of the twenty-first centuries.\n",
      "1 \t\t Upon hearing about this show after the fifth season had already concluded, I was very pessimistic about it, due to the fact that it was described to me as a 'romantic drama TV series about a group of friends in their late twenties. One hoping to find true love, two happily married to each other, one who has a fear of commitment, and a womanizing single who is wholly against any form of monogamy.\" Finally caving into the pressure of multiple friends to watch this \"groundbreaking\" show, I was surprised to find that it was completely different than the by-the-book, over-the-top sex comedy that would be short lived and grow old quickly that I was expecting. Instead what I got was a well-rounded TV drama with very three-denominational characters who are dynamic in every episode. Ted, the one looking for true love, has many layers and is not a by-the-book single 26 year old. Marshall and Lilly are a very cute couple that in my experience behave very similar to married couples of their age and truly are in love. Robin, instead of being just afraid of commitment, has a very real dilemma of wanting to fall in love, but having major anxieties about commitment. And finally to everyone's favorite HIMYM character Mr. Suit Up himself Barney Stinson. This character is perfectly crafted, and very original. He is not your typical womanizing loser, but he truly has dimension. From father issues to conflicted feelings about a single woman, to struggling with his best friends he is truly a very intriguing character that keeps you on the edge of your seat. From the first five minutes of the pilot I was hooked. It has heart, and decent lessons. A very real, drama that confronts very real issues. It's funny, it's smart, it's terrific. Definitely worth your time. It's had a great run and even through all it's seasons up-to-date it has remained equally as good as it's original seasons.\n",
      "1 \t\t I'll start off by saying How I Met Your Mother was a great show. The only show ever that made me laugh, tear up and also made me feel excited. It was an Emotional Roll-Coaster and it's one of my favourite shows. That being said I hated the ending! The whole mother dying from some illness blew my mind and not in a good way. The whole show was about Ted finding true love and then when he finds it she ends up dying after only 10 years together? As much as I enjoy this show it really was a disappointment. Now I've read some reviews and a lot of people said they didn't enjoy the last few seasons, well I have to disagree with that because I loved them as much as the Beginning seasons. The ending and only the ending was just a complete and utter disappointment to me. It kinda took the whole point of the show for me and took it to whole other place. Which sucked but I'm not that upset because every other episode in my opinion took me on the emotional Roll-Coaster I loved from the very first episode... The show was Legen-Wait for it... Dary! :)\n",
      "0 \t\t Actors - trash, \"comedy - trash\" made for typical mentaly low american kid/teenager, who havent seen a real thug life jokes and he think this is funny...\n",
      "0 \t\t This was fun to watch in the early 2000's. It was silly, had fun inuendos, and characters that developed, aged, and changed.After the first two seasons, the premise of a father talking about how he met every woman in New York before he met the kids mother, started to fall apart. Filler episode after filler episode became the point and it lost all charm.So, I watched it through season 5 and gave up.I just threw in the first two episodes of seasons 6 and the acting was terrible, the\n",
      "Jokes were flat, and it was overly schmaultzy. Maybe I was too young to see this all those years ago, but I can't unsee it. I know how it's going to end (which is a stupid plot twist), and I can honestly say that it's not good... just a passable generic sitcom with too many sex jokes, bad acting, and a silly cast of caricatures.\n",
      "1 \t\t I dont know how many more times do l need to watch this great comedy show , I really love it every time l watch , it s the only tv show that makes me laugh and enjoy everytime l watch it ... :)\n",
      "1 \t\t This one has everything. Not just Comedy but also an beautiful story told in an interesting manner. This show is one of the shows which implemented the nonlinear narrative, time jumps, censoring certain things by sanwich, blabla etc, I could talk about this show for hours. But here's what you should know. It can make you cry at times and this is one of the shows which thought me some valuable life lessons like life is unpredictable and not always has an happy ending.It had one of the saddest ending of all time still it made me watch it as you can enjoy the journey even if you know where it leads to. This is also one of the quotes from the series. It also the best dialogues for a sitcom. And last but not the least Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, is my favourite sitcom character of all time. You can just watch this show for his marvellous performance.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love most of the cast,(Robin annoying) and in the most part this is a good show. I have been watching it since it started and it just seems that we haven't learn nothing new in all the years its been on. This season I thought finally at least we knew something and then at the end they made it all confusing again. I for one think this show is getting old. I don't want to see it end but at the same time I hate myself a little every time I sit to watch. If it was for NPH I wouldn't watch it at all. I am not going to be watching it no more till all of the season is on my DVR. Lets see if they finally move it along. Maybe we could finally know who the heck is the mother!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a very simple love story, about a guy meeting his wife.We can easily connect with all the characters. They are very \"human\". We can see a lot of a \"pre-middle\" age crisis in Ted, romantic, dreaming about settle down. Lily and Marshall are that couple we all know that has been together forever. Robin is the hot and sexy out of our league friend/dream girl. Barney is the self-centered but funny friend who sometimes we can't stand, but we can't live without.Being that simple and straight to the point, how can you make it last for so long? And why???? Overall, the first seasons were very good, with lots of twists and turns, funny clues and an overwhelming Stinson! But after season 5... I think they lost the point. Nowadays, we see very little development in each character. There are episodes with no story at all. Flashbacks, which used to be one of the best parts of the show, are becoming lame, stupid and pointless. 7 out of 10, only because it would be unfair to ignore that it started as an excellent show...\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't know where to begin. I watched HIMYM a few times already and every time it was like I was watching it for the first time. You experience every kind of feeling throughout the series and really learn to love every single character. The attention to detail and the little things happening in the beginning which make a huge difference afterwards are just brilliant! I truly love this series and I'll definitely watch it again and not just one time! Truly worth the time.\n",

      "A few years ago, I started watching this show. it was on netflix and I had always wanted to watch it. Cause I had seen a few scenes when it aired before the simpsons on TV.\n",
      "And at the time, I really enjoyed that show. But I could never really figure out what it was that made me enjoy it so much.When I finished the last season, I knew I needed to rewatch the show. Or at least my favorite episodes. But for some reason, that never happened. I had all the time in the world, but I never got around to watching it again.\n",
      "But finally, after years of waiting, I had to rewatch it. And to be honest, I liked it even more. Here's why:\n",

      "At first, I still couldn't understand what it was that made it so watchable. What it was that made me want to keep watching it over and over again. But then I figured it out. It was the characters.To this day, I have never seen any media this well made characters. And it's not that they are the characters with the most depth, or uniqueness I have seen. I have definitely seen shows with more interesting or realistic characters.\n",
      "But it was the first time I have wanted to come back to a show so much just because of the characters.\n",
      "They're really funny and fit together really well. But they also show new sides of themself and change over time. And the best way to show you that is by explaining my favorite character of the show. And it is, wait for it, Barney Stinson.\n",
      "What's so weird about this character is how much he surprised me. At first, I thought he would become my least favorite character. That he would stay the same throughout the show and would become stale after telling the same joke over and over again.\n",
      "But that never happened. He constantly surprised me with the new sides he would show and how much he would change. But it was never too much. I could see that he changed, but still see his past.\n",
      "And that's what made his character so memorable. That while he was very fun to watch, he also had an emotional side and could become different.\n",
      "And I don't think I have seen this good of a character development in a show before. It was kind of incredible.\n",
      "But the reason for giving the show a 9 instead of a 10 is probably because of the visuals and story.I don't have a lot to say about the visuals, other than some of it looked really bad.\n",
      "For the most part, it looked pretty good. It wasn't anything special, but still pretty good.\n",
      "But then there were moments where they used green screen effects that looked really bad. Backgrounds with bad quality, bad CGI. It just took me out of the show.\n",
      "But fortunately, that wasn't very prevalent in the show. What was more important was the story.You may think it was the ending that made me think that. And while you are partially right, I had other problems too.\n",
      "Cause for the most part, the story was pretty great.\n",
      "A theme I saw in the show was \"how important change is\", and I thought it was really interesting and I haven't seen a show use that theme in the same way.\n",
      "That every season ends with some sort of change.\n",
      "A change in relationships, a change in friendship, a change in career, a change in mental state.\n",
      "A change in what you have believed would be the future.What made it knowing that Ted would end up with another girl so great, was how well it implemented into the theme.\n",
      "That even though Ted though he would end up with Robin, that would all change when he meets another girl.But that's where it all goes south.\n",
      "My problem with the story, is the \"how i met your mother\" part. That may sound contradictory to what I just said, but I'll explain.In many segments of the show, Ted tells his kids how important that moment was for finding their mother. But few of them actually feel important. I was rarely believed that those moments actually had a big impact on their lives.\n",
      "It mainly felt like they wanted to have comedy slice of life show, but was kind of forced to have a story/romance element because of the time it was created.And then we get to the end.\n",
      "This is where my praises for the theme kind of crash. Cause in the very last episode, the theme either disappears completely, or go too far.\n",
      "I have two examples for this.In one of the later scenes, \"the gang\" get back together after not having hanged out in a while. Barney seems really excited about this. But contradictory to that, when he sees two attractive girls walk next to they're table, Barney runs after them. It seems like he is back to his old self.\n",
      "But then it is revealed that barney actually tells them to go home and dress less lightly, so that people like his old self wouldn't come near them.This is an example where the theme of change goes too far in my opinion. I can't see Barneys old self. I see a completely new person.\n",
      "I know it has been a while since they saw each other, and that he has changed even more than he did throughout the show. But realistically, he shouldn't have become a completely new person.Then we have examples where the theme disappears completely. And this is where the end part comes into play.\n",
      "Like I said before, the thing that made knowing that Ted would end up with someone else in the end so good was how it played into the theme.\n",
      "But now, that all changes, and Ted finally ends up with the girl she always knew.\n",
      "It kind of feels like the show wants you to believe that if you wait long enough, then the married girl might become yours in the end. That might be a stretch, but that's just my thoughts\n",
      "But as I said, I still REALLY liked the show. So to end this review, I just want to show some of my favorite episodes of the whole show. Those are probably the ones I'll rewatch casually if I don't rewatch everything.From chronological order, here are my favorite episodes:\n",
      "Swarley (S2 E7)\n",
      "Monday Night Football (S2 E14)\n",
      "Stuff (S2 E16) (Could be my favorite)\n",
      "All the slapsgiving ones (S3 E9, S5 E9, S9 E14)\n",
      "The Robin Sparkles ones\n",
      "Murtaught (S4 E19)\n",
      "Tick tick tick (S7 E10)Probably forgot a few. I just looked through all the episodes on netflix and wrote down the ones I remember being really funny.\n",
      "Just to clarify. This doesn't mean I dislike the other episodes. Just that they weren't as funny to me\n",
      "So yeah, there you have it. Even though I have a lot of problems with the show, I will always keep it dear to my heart. Have a good dayBTW, I think it is my sixth favorite show of all time. Could become worse or better, we'll just have to see\n",
      "1 \t\t I used to absolutely love this, it was original-ish(i will get to why said \"ish\" later), witty smart and funny, but lately in the latest episodes it has made NO sense what-so-ever. It was jut random stuff put together that had nothing to with the story line. Not even the how he met their mother story line because lets face it, they haven't really been focusing o that anyways. But it didn't even have to do with anything of the other story lines. Not only that, but they've changed Barney from the LEGEN-wait for it-DARY character that he was to some mushy love-struck puppy, Ted has gotten super whiny and pathetic(as man reviews have already said), Robin, well i actually like Robin, I can't even explain what has happened to Marshmallow and Lily-pad. I had said original-ish at first because I'm a HUGE FRIENDS fan, so I've been watching it a lot lately, then i watch HIMYM and realize... that the EXACT same thing happened in FRIENDS. They change a few details so that maybe people won't notice, but as I've read some of theses reviews many people have. Not only have they taken situations from FRIENDS, but they have taken ideas and relationships. It's like the writers literally watch FRIENDS and take notes for stuff they can take from FRIENDS.As i said I used to love this show so I won't give up on it just yet. I'm still going to watch it every week in case it gets better, hopefully. If it doesn't by the end of this season, I'm sorry but I'm done.One last thing, many people who are fans of this show only like it because of Barney and only Barney. I realized this even more when i was talking to my friend one day and she actually thought Barney was the main character. In my opinion they might as well make the show about him.\n",
      "1 \t\t I absolutely loved this show when it came around. It was super funny, it was sweet and accessible even to people who aren't interested in the romantic drama aspects that they involved. The journey of Ted (Josh Radnor) trying to find his soulmate was a unique way to tell a story and it was very whimsical. Every episode felt like you were sitting down with a family member and listening to them tell stories. They had some great side characters with actors/actresses in those roles giving stellar performances. I find it hard to believe that anyone would watch this show and come away not being super impressed with Neil Patrick Harris who plays Ted's friend Barney. Even though I just said a lot of nice things about How I Met Your Mother, his performance is what made this show special. Alyson Hannigan (Lily) and Jason Segel (Marshall) are fun to watch as a couple and add in Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky) and there's a really good group dynamic. For the first few seasons, the writing is strong and there's always some new concept being introduced like hot/crazy scale, the crazy eyes, the Murtaugh list or Slapsgiving. I was watching the show on a weekly basis and I couldn't wait for the next episode to come on.But then like most good sitcoms, the show went on too long. The characters that were so great start to drift into stereotypes. Barney's womanizing ways slowly dissolve, Marshall becomes more and more effeminate, Robin's laid back attitude goes away and especially Ted really started to irritate me. He gets beautiful women thrown at him constantly and he's so irrationally picky that he's no longer the sympathetic underdog and more of a jack@$$. The worst offence is how they treat the mother Tracy (Cristin Miloti). There's so much buildup to her arrival, so many episodes teasing her identity and then in the big finale she's so unceremoniously cast aside, I was angry. I know they decided on the ending when the show began (from what I heard they filmed parts of the finale just after the pilot) and that's fine but the show moved so far away from the conclusion that they decided upon that the finale seemed so out of place. These problems are common, I get why this happened to How I Met Your Mother but as a big fan of the show, the drop off in quality was still really disappointing.I wouldn't blame the actors, they all did good work and some of them went on to bigger things, so good for them. Most people I have discussed this show with who were fans have a similar reaction, there was a jumping off point for almost everyone, it just wasn't always the same point. For me it was about season 7, after that watching it on a weekly basis became less important and when season 9 came around, I was barely watching it at all. I tuned in for the finale and wished I hadn't it felt like such a betrayal of what had been setup originally. Seasons 1-6 I would give a 10 but 7-9 I would give a 3 or a 4. I'll average it out and split the difference.\n",
      "1 \t\t Legen...wait for it... dary yeah its legendary.This show is quite amazing. I really wanted Ted to marry Robin but finally in the end they were together that was a happy ending. Barny was quite awesome and Marshall and lily were fabulous together.\n",
      "1 \t\t Thought this series have many flows... I would recommend it to each and every \"FRIENDS FAN\"\n",
      "1 \t\t Yep, that's my own wordplay from the series' famous quotes. So for many years I never bothered to watch TV shows. Just never could seem to remember the times they came on and waiting for re-runs became way less than awesome. So I just decided to buy them on DVD when they came out. I got a bunch. This show, however, never made my cut on most intriguing shows to watch. I don't remember why. 2005 to 2011 were dark times my friends, dark times indeed, well 2009 and 2010 were pretty good at least. When I started to watch them I couldn't believe that I hadn't before. All I can say was that I wasn't ready to watch. A few years ago I would have missed the clever writing and not understood why some things happened, such as the twists and stuff (by the way, if you just pay attention to the foreshadowing there wouldn't be surprises).That's when Netflix came in adding HIMYM to their streaming and suddenly a whole new world opened to me. I was amazed by how funny and grounded, loosely, in reality this show was.Season 6 is easily my favorite and the episode in which Marshall's father dies is my favorite episode, because it made me laugh and cry, and I didn't even know about the countdown thing. I don't think that was a good idea because the show is a funny show so when you announce a countdown then it just takes away what the episode was supposed to mean: reality hits hard. Instead it was like something exciting was expected but instead Marshall's Dad died. Bad move, but take away the countdown and it's a very special episode. Now, I completely understand that we all have a timer in our lives so it is very symbolic in terms of life and death. At first I thought it was brilliant, but when I thought about it more I realized that it wasn't because you have an audience who expected something amazingly awesome. I am never going to say something like comedies should never have people die, because that is just untrue. Comedy comes hand and hand with sadness. Why do you think that the symbol for comedy are two masks, one happy and one sad? If all you have is laughs and laughs then what's the point? The most epic comedies aren't afraid of using that sad mask because that is LIFE. Life is both a happy thing and a sad thing. By hiding that is to completely miss the point. It wouldn't have been a surprise if you paid attention to the many times Marshall's Dad called and he didn't pick up. Whenever there is a story that has something like that you have to be aware that a death is coming to either character, usually to the person doing the calling.Thanks to DVR I finally caught up on the series and can't wait for next season. Season 7 ended in a predictable way. Even though Barney proposed to Quin I knew it was Robin who was the bride. The first hint was given in episode 1 and never left me. Robin told Barney that the bride wanted him. Why?? It had to be Robin. The writers tried to take swerves to distract people, but once you understand their love to have twists and their pattern of those twists then it's obvious you can't allow yourself to be distracted, but just enjoy. When Barney was with Quin it was obvious he was going to eventually propose so I tried to see any hints of Quin getting to know Ted really well and become good friends but there were none, hint number 5. They never got close so therefore there was no need for Quin to ask for Ted. Throughout the whole season Ted and Robin each needed to speak with each other alone, that was hint number 4 whether intentional or not. So there was no surprise. Hint number 2 was that the emphasis was put on Robin this season more harder, in terms of seriousness, more than in the past seasons so there had to be a tying of that storyline that involved her in a happy place. Finally, hint number 3 was when Kevin proposed to her, and Barney, of course we knew that he was getting married. That's storytelling.Do I agree that they should have ended up together? NO. I think that, once again, was a bad idea. I never liked them being together, nor did I like Robin and Ted ending up together also but at least they had better chemistry. The writers try to push that Barney and Robin are so much alike, but the truth is that they are very different so I have no idea why they try so hard on that.So don't be surprised if Barney and Robin aren't actually tying the knot.I can just imagine Ted walking into that room and be like, \"Uh, Robin, what are you doing?\" Why? Because Ted had a surprised look on his face when Robin told him that the Bride was calling for him. That may mean nothing though or I could have miss-read his expression.Then Robin would be like, \"I have to tell Barney that it's me he should be with.\" after knocking Quin out. Why? Because she already assaulted a woman, well it was to protect Barney, but either way.Or, a double wedding, now hear me out. Kevin could return ... now the more I think about it the more it sounds crazy so the more it could be valid for the mentality of those crazy writers.Either way there's never knowing with this show.I just don't like Barney and Robin together so minus 1 point. Not my choice though.The show, however, is my favorite comedy now regardless.\n",
      "1 \t\t Such smart writing with amazing performances. This cast is so underrated. Coming off the tails of FRIENDS phenomenon, they often get overshadowed, but I believe this cast is far superior. It is by far, my favorite show of all time.\n",
      "0 \t\t Fresh off the Boat, Schitt's Creek and this \"show\": I suppose all of them were created to entertain people with loud, obnoxious 'characters'. I hope there are some people who found themselves entertained. God what an utter piece of manure this show is.\n",
      "0 \t\t Irritating characters. Boring show. Unfunny jokes. All together frustrating experience. It's even annoying as background noise. I don't understand how anyone can like this show.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is the BEST show out there. The storyline is incredible and the producers should be proud because they really did something. I have never been so engaged with a show and that makes me so happy. I personally loved the ending , it's how it should have ended and It was amazing. The show actually makes me enjoy life and I often find myself always quoting lines from the show and its great. Just fab and the actors/actresses chosen to play these roles were prefect . Anyways , 10/10 would recommend, trust me it's gonna be legen...Wait for it....Dary. Please give it a try.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met Your Mother would be the winner contestant for the Friends 2.0 spot. It had a very interesting premise, with a man recounting his single life, before meeting the mother of his children, to said children. It was both risky and exciting. Only as popularity grew, fandoms became more vocal than most viewers, and as the show aired during an era of « internetizaton » it suffered a lot from a writing catering to what some wished to see. Where older sitcoms were smart enough not to indulge in silly fans requests, How I met Your Mother, did it in a way that spoiled a big portion of its episodes. Thankfully, good writing mostly took over, and these digressions can be seen as honest mistakes. Mistakes that were ultimately dealt with by the end of its run. Characters dynamics were that of a « Friends » as well. Only pushed to some extremes sometimes, it made HIMYM be its own series. With its own sense of humor and universe. Guest stars worked perfectly, as well as red herring mothers. And even though the series aged. Which is fine, and necessary even. It's one of the last genuinely good sitcoms, with its 90s approach (it was both PC and offensive) and best episodes (Slapsgiving comes to mind). I can pin point which are my favorite seasons, mostly two and five, but others have great episodes and twists too, that make up for some of the cringeworthy writing.\n",
      "0 \t\t Wow wow...crap! Teds poor me, Teds \"I am still single\", and Teds \"Its all about MY feelings\" is more than annoying. Without the character Ted, it would be alot funnier and entertaining. It feels like they tried to mix 2 hillarious Tv shows into 1, Cheers and Friends, without success.\n",
      "1 \t\t I liked the cast. Nice script, natural acting and touches real life themes.\n",

      "1 \t\t People keep comparing it to friends but to me, this show is a million times better. The characters have so much depth and their development throughout the series is huge. I rewatched after 5 years and now I get everything in a different manner. It made so much more sense and it made me appreciate every minute of the show because of how well it was thought out. First time I watched it I was really bummed by the turn out of the events but the second time I understood why it was meant to be that way and how thoroughly every little detail was planned. I cried watching How I Met Your Mother so many times, even though every good cry was compensated by crazy laughs. This is the show that has made me \"feel\" the most even if it is supposed to be comedy. I don't think I will ever watch anything as great as this. Thank you!\n",

      "I had a few drawbacks with the show. Firstly, I was very pleased with Barney and Robins relationship and character development which was very heartfelt. It confused me when Barney directly went back to his old self. \n",
      "I wish they had showed the mother halfway through(possibly season 4-5), the whole show is revolved around meeting her, and one season did not do her justice. \n",
      "I wish they had showed the death of the mother in one complete episode. Its like they summed up the most important part in 5 minutes of the last episode when is could have needed at least 20 to offer the viewers, the actors, and the show the most ultimate closure of letting go. \n",
      "How I met your mother failed to do that which caused a lot of angry viewers with a disappointing ending. However, for me, the ending of him going back to Robin was absolutely perfect, and the killing of the mother was genius. \n",
      "It has always been Ted and Robin from the first episode that we see their eyes glancing at one another. The fact that The mother had also lost her lover in a car crash makes her death even more valuable because shes finally with her loved one as well. This show values the importance of the universe and destiny. It was absolutely brilliant because Robin and Ted were always meant to be, but Robin couldn't give Ted the thing her wants most: KIDS. \n",

But this show gave me so much life lessons. Like Ted, love has been a hard and very tricky situation for me. I relate to his character so much that sometimes the pain that he suffers with some of his relationships, namely the one with Robin. This show is something very close to me and I will be sad when it all ends tonight. Thank you for 9 years of great quotes and moments, I will cherish them and like Ted himself, will try to live and do things my own way. Whether it will work now or far later on!:\n",

First of all, yes, I liked Robin and Barney, but let's face it they never had the kind of chemistry Robin and Ted had and it was a little bit obvious their relationship wasn't gonna last forever . As for Ted and Tracy what can i say.. they were perfect for each other but Ted was always supposed to end up with Robin, at least in my opinion. I mean the look on his face whenever he see's her and the fact that he loved her for over 8 years till he met Tracy, that kind of love can't disappear completely and i'm not saying that he didn't loved Tracy with all his heart I'm just saying that Robin was and always has been in his heart and the whole story is kinda about him falling in love with her over and over again so it made sense in the end them ending up together.. so that's why I'm not sad about the ending cause for me it was the perfect ending, I mean they could have kissed but overall it was a perfect ending to a beautiful show.\n",
      "1 \t\t By nature HIMYM is a sitcom and always manages to deliver timeless jokes leaving you laughing till your heart hurts. But HIMYM is so much more than that, this is a story about friendships and the joys and pains of growing up. Never have i watched a show with such well written character developments.\n",
      "This show does a great job of making you care for these characters, so when they are happy so are you and when they are sad so are you.\n",
      "1 \t\t I once heard someone say:\"They should rename the show to how I banged a bunch of chicks and met your mother\" but I don't think that fits I think a much more fitting title would be:\"How I became the person who met your mother\" because that's what this is. A father telling his children a story about the character growth he went through to finally be ready to meat the woman of his dreams.The comedy is well balanced with the themes of the different episodes. The running gags are memorable and most of the time funny.The themes it tackels are most of the time not that seroius, but sometimes you come across a serious one and they nail those as well. Take \"Last words\" as an example. The themes is pretty heavy with the loss of Marshals father and loss in general but they lighten it up by some jokes.They also pay much attention to details most people won't even notice. Take \"Bad News\" where they count down from 50 to 1 to the real Bad News of the Episode.I have watched this Show like 5 times already and It still manages to crack me up.TL;DR Probably the best show I have ever seen\n",
      "1 \t\t Its a really cool sitcom i really recommend it to you.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is the best.. it talks about friendships and relationships in a funny way... this show makes me laugh cry and smile... i love barney he makes the show more funnier.. i love his personality 😂 he's kind of a stupid but i like him.. hope you guys love this show.. and if you didn't watched yet.

Even if your'e not gonna like the series you're gonna love Barney.I'd give it a 10 but I didn't really like the ending. 'cause I didn't really liked the character Robin. She was confusing, indecisive and I think she would make a better couple with Barney.TO THE ONES WHO THINK IT'S JUST THE COPY OF FRIENDS: I watched both series and they're totally different. So don't judge it before watching.Hope you'll enjoy watching it!\n",
      "(Edit: My initial rating was 9, but after my 2nd rewatch I changed it to 10. It's just great:))\n",
      "0 \t\t This show has absolutely nothing new, its gimmick is stupid, the editing is bad...and Alyson Hannigan (however you spell it) is just awful. She has now used up all of her good will from \"Band Camp\" making her a two-role person.Someone should let her in on the joke because she is not funny, but it's not all her fault, the script is lame, but her delivery makes you want to cringe.The other actors are rip-offs of \"Friends\" and their dialog isn't much better.Absolutely atrocious, unless 2 1/2 Men can save it, it will off the air by the end of the season.\"You don't have a right to an opinion...you have the right to an INFORMED opinion.\"\n",
      "1 \t\t HIMYM is quite funny, the characters are MOSTLY good but they have their flaw. It is way funnier than FRIENDS. The bro-ship between Barney and Ted is awesome, the relationship between Lily and Marshall is amazing.

The first few seasons are boring but then it gets better.\n",
      "1 \t\t When i first heard the name of the show, i did not think i would love it. The title of it, is a bit weird (-How i met your mother? - My mother!? :) However, when i started to see the episodes, i exactly loved it. Ted is a great character in the show, as he is trying to find his ideal girl. (hope that is Robin :) He is someone from the real life, we see Teds in the streets, at cafe, at school. But Barney is legen..wait for it..daryy :) He became an idol of the majority \"How i met your mother\" fans. Some people thinks sexual jokes are disturbing. I think they are not overdone. Actually Barney does sexual jokes perfectly by using a good way, and makes us laugh. Thank you Barney, Thank you Ted, Thank you How i met your mother staff. Good job!\n",
      "0 \t\t Some really funny and heartwarming scenes in this series, but mostly it's just okay.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I hear people lament, \"There's nothing good on TV anymore,\" this is one of the programs that I can use for my disagreement! \"How I Met\" is well-cast, well-written, and has excellent character development. You have one male \"in\" love, one \"looking\" for love, and one only wanting to \"make love\"! You also have one female \"in\" love and one \"looking\" for love! The writing is extraordinary, especially with Neil Patrick Harris, who I thought would never be anything but Doogie Howser! The lines he has been given are hilarious: It's gonna be legendary; Whazzup; etc.It definitely reminds me of the years I lived in NYC! Looking for love, finding love (or thinking I found love), being out of love! This show just shows that there is good television on TV!I am so looking forward to season 2!\n",
      "1 \t\t Neil patrick harris is the best part of this show. he's amazingly funny, and he has all of the best lines on the show. When it came out that he was gay that was even cooler, because here he playing this outrageous womanizer. It's great. I can honestly say that when this show first came out, I thought it was just another show trying to do the Friends thing. But it very different. Much funnier. Although the parts when the dad is talking to the kids are kinda useless. But I guess that's why there have been less and less of them. This show is one of the few shows that my husband and I even bother to watch on TV anymore. Hopefully it says around for a while.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is one of my favorite TV series. It's really gripping. Its type is a sitcom and these TV series start in 2005 and the last season finished in 2014 and the series takes place in New York.\n",
      "Basically, its plot is about the lead actor's (Ted Mosby) life story with his best four friends. They are Barney, Robin, Lily, and Marshall. Ted talks about his kids how he met their mother in the past. While talking about this, he mentioned the life story and spent years with his best friends. This makes the series both entertaining and allows us to watch each episode by wondering about Ted's wife. I even thought we would never learn Ted's wife, but we did.\n",

      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is a very great series to watch and people who have watched Friends and TBBT will absolutely love it. But on the other hand you can't expect a lot of comedy but yeah there's a lot of romance and a few amazing episodes that makes this series a good one to watch. So overall it's worth to watch and you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is definitely one of the best American sitcom. It is the funniest dramas with eccentric humor I have ever seen. The producers of this comedy, Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, created an entertaining romantic story full of awkward and amusing moments, so I have not one bad word to say about it. This comedy, with interesting plot and irresistible characters, is certainly my favorite.The story is about the adventures of architect Ted Mosby and his friends, and how he met the mother of his children. However, the comedy is not similar to a traditional love-story, which begins from the moment when the romantic leads first meet each other. The structure of this drama is absolutely unique, Ted Mosby does not introduce his wife until the final season. Additionally, the series start with Ted retelling to his children in 2030 the story about how he was so close to meet their mother. He had been seeking his love for 8 years. Ted failed a lot, but his crazy friends every time provided him social and emotional support. With a lovely couple Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin, womanizer Barney Sticnson with a secret job (you also will find out it only in the final season) and funny anchor Robin Sharbatsky, Ted has unforgettable adventures and a number of ridiculous stories.How I met your mother is suitable for everyone. It's a really positive, humorous and amazing comedy, which you can watch with your friends and with your family as well. However, parents need to know that this comedy focuses on flirting, love and relationships, includes sexual jokes and some vulgar language. On the other hand, some obscene things are substituted with interesting activities, and it makes stories more comical. At the same time this drama has controversial ending, which suggests that sometimes life has no happy endings. Overall It's easy watching sitcom with different funny story lines, so you will never be bored.\n",

      "1 \t\t This is less of a review & more of a comparisonSome say this show is a remake of friends, this will never be able to surpass friends, this show hasn't been as good as it used to be, this show has gone down since 6th season......I say hell no...hell noo.....hell nooooEnough has been said & thats why I m writing a review. This show brought things which no other show could & this review is not from someone who has watched only 1st & 2nd season. I have watched all the episodes that have aired & i have watched all the seasons of Friends as well. Agreed that Friends & HIMYM do have some similarities but this show has managed to get its own individuality.Here's the comparison between the two:-Ted v/s Ross- Although David Schwimmer(Ross) is a better actor, but Josh Radnor(Ted) in HIMYM has definitely done a better job at being humorous & pitiful , while Ross was merely funny although he was much more pathetic. Ted is cute & funny while Ross is ugly and boring. Ted's the guy around which the show revolves whereas Ross was just a sidekick. That's enough to describe Ted's importance to the show. Rachel v/s Robin- Robin is superhot, she's the hottest newsreader ever to feature on TV while Rachel maybe hot but loses to Robin. Although Jennifer became a style icon with that hairstyle, I never quite admired her looks because of her butterface. I m comparing the looks as these two actors are supposed to bring glamor to the show. Talking about acting, Robin also has her second personality- Robin Sparkles(lets go to the mall........today). She's funny with her Canadian accent and unconvincing Canadian jokes. Rachel was funny but the two characters are quite different from each other. My vote goes to Robin.Lily v/s Monica- Lily is bitchy and manipulative but funny nevertheless. Monica used to be graceful and conscious in earlier seasons but all went wrong after her nose-job, she was never the same to me. It was unnecessary, she was ageing gracefully. For me it's a tie, both aren't the best in the show but are immensely important to the respective shows.Marshall v/s Chandler- Marshall is a one-woman man whereas Chandler turned into one. Although Chandler's character isn't the best written one but he still pulls it off. Marshall has his moments but Chandler is better. Pheobe v/s ??? Cannot be compared although Pheobe was a weird character & a very lovable one. The couples- Chandler & Monica are better than Marshall & Lily as a couple. Talking about Ted and Robin- they share a great chemistry till date. Dosen't matter whether he gets her or not but Ross and Rachel could never create the same excitement like this on/off relationship. Fans still want Robin and Ted somehow to end-up together. I never cared about Ross & Rachel, although they were funny as individuals but their chemistry never touched me.Mclaren's v/s Central Perk- A bar v/s a coffee shop. I prefer Mclarens coz all the awesome things happen there. The Apartments- Friends brought a homely feeling in their sets,while HIMYM's sets were more dudely(if there is a word like that). I would give this one to.......wait a minute........ Barney's apartment rocks & shall be declared as a historical monument in the history of television. I would love to live in that place. Concept- Friends was the original one, so I would give this one to Friends. But the drama and suspense created in HIMYM are entirely different from Friends and situations were way more funny. The mystery also helps HIMYM to evolve as a different show. Agreed that the show wasn't at its peak in 6th & 7th season but was watchable & is better than friends in its 1st two seasons. Friends didn't have a story within a story & friends didn't have a narrative structure.Music- HIMYM has some of the best songs played of the two shows although friends has a better title track.& now comes the big comparison Barney v/s Joey- From the very first season Barney introduced the funniest of dialogs & situations of both the shows",
      "",
      "",
      "or any other show.. Have u met Ted?, Legend......wait for it.......dary, Awesomeness (when he's sad he stops being sad & instead he starts being awesome), Challenge accepted, Suit-up, Daddy's home, the Playbook, the Bro-code, Bros & Wingmans, hi-5s, true stories, daddy issues, Broman times,slap bet(slapsgiving), resurrection of Jesus, hot-crazy scale..... & many more that I m not able to recall. Afterall there were so many hilarious situations & punchlines that made me burst into laughter even when I watch the show alone. Someone please give this guy a medal & erect his statue.Think of him as yoda but instead of being little & green he wears suits & he's awesome. He's Ted's bro",
      "",
      "he's broda. This guy is the heart & soul of the show and no womanizer on TV can surpass this guy forever.The irony is.... he's gay but he can make anyone look sissy on screen. I would never forget the songs he created for Ted's sister & yes Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. Now a Friends fanatic would still root for Joey but I'm not writing this review to convince anyone. My Scores- Barney-100, Joey-10Both shows have their moments. I loved both but HIMYM has created more suspense along with drama & comedy. Those who gave this show 1 star don't know a s**t about this show & are friends' fanatics. I would advise viewers watch this show without any prejudice & then decide. My vote for now - HIMYM-9.5 & Friends-9. But I will give my final verdict only after the HIMYM ends .\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is the most popular sitcom of 00s. So i decided to watch it for find out why's everyone loving it. After first few average episodes it really grew on me. The characterization is great. I can't decide who is the best character. Some episodes are amazingly funny. Usually writing is very brilliant. It makes you wonder who's the mysterious mother.I'm on the fourth season now and i'm addicted to this show. If you wanna start a good sitcom like Friends you should give it a try. 8.5/10. Best Seasons: Seasons 1,2,3,4.\n",
      "1 \t\t HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER has to be the funniest, if not the Best Comedy in a long time. Bob Sagat telling the story to his teenage kids is fresh on his life before meeting his future wife. But each episode gets better and better. The greatest part is that every character is funny like on FRIENDS, from Ted to Marshall to Barney. It's an excellent cast with Neil Patrick Harris (Stark Raving Mad) and Alyson Hannigan (American Pie). Nice to see Bloopers/Outtakes on the Season One DVD Release. It's great to watch it after King Of Queens and I hope HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER stays on air for a long time, at least until they show Ted marrying his children's Mother!!\n",
      "1 \t\t It is impossible to talk about HIMYM while not mentioning FRIENDS. This show definetly fills up the space of Comedy/Romance that is left in ones life after watching The most amazing season ever existed on planet earth i.e. FRIENDS.\n",
      "This show followed the FRIENDS but it established it's own identity as the series go ahead. The main character for me was NPH aka Neil Patrick Harris but all five of the characters added to make another perfect FRIENDS like environment .\n",
      "This series is more dominated by romance and less than comedy but acting,emotions every thing is amazing. Writers did some blunders but you can ignore this when actors are doing such an amazing job and over the period of watching this show you can ignore such things. \n",
      "Amazing show, Humor is good, Romance is brilliant. A must watch.\n",
      "1 \t\t To me, How I Met Your Mother is more than just a show. The characters really make you feel like you are a part of their group. They make you want to be their friend. You are sad when they are sad, you are happy when they are happy, and you want to hug them when they have a broken heart. This show really sucks you in and makes you feel like you are a part of it. It is funny, it is sad, it is dramatic; it is everything rolled into one! I have seen the show many times, and I still laugh at the funny parts and cry at the sad parts. I really feel like the characters are my friends and care a lot about them. It is really hard deciding on one favorite episode or moment, because there are so many that I love. The actors really bring this show to life. How I Met Your Mother will always have a special place in my heart and I love watching it over and over!!\n",
      "1 \t\t Legen wait for it dary. But end of the ending scene of the series no wait for it only Legendary.\n",
      "1 \t\t My all-time favorite. From beginning to end, even though many didn't like the end. Great show with potential to literally change your life or at least have a big impact on it.\n",
      "Ratings actually not good enough.\n",
      "1 \t\t Years after it came out I have just been watching this show on Hulu. I really enjoy it. It's funny and lighthearted. Except BARNEY. Barney is pretty much a misogynist dickhead. His sexist and debasing comments and treatment of women is really not funny. Why would anyone be friends with this guy? Great show that would totally stand up well without this character.\n",
      "1 \t\t Ted is like the Brad Pitt of the Series, He is obssesed to get married with a woman, he fell in love of each women that appears in the show. All the beautiful women fell in love about him. That bar that its a copy of Friends Cerntral Perk is full of hot women. He destroy the life of the beautiful girl Zoey coming into a married women saying that she might be the mother of her kids and that he \"loves her\" and then he kick her arsh and say that he is a good person. All his friends are obsessed to make him find a girlfriend. In one epidose his friends were in his room and he said What am I going to do? And Lily offer him her room for him to have sex! Cmon! I will never lend my room to others for have sex!!Another room Marshal and Lily were not able to go out from the toilet because Ted were going to get laid with a girl and they were in the living room. And to not \"destroy\" the date, they preffer to stay hours inside the bathroom.He see Victoria again and even that she said that she is engage, he do everything to try to kiss her and He do it!!!Im not sure why I get so far on this tv show, maybe because of the covid time just to watch something but I hate Ted \"Pitt\" and his obsession to fell in love in each girl that he found on the way and he love them all and all of them will become the mother of his kidas...\n",
      "pfffff no comments.\n",
      "1 \t\t It's my favourite sitcom though the ending SUCKS, Robin should have ended with Barney and the 'mother' should never have died. Robin is too good for Ted and their relationship was awful. But it's still the best sitcom ever.\n",
      "0 \t\t HIMYM had an interesting story but the jokes were lame even in the early seasons, it seemed all the subtlety has drained out off the writers in the later seasons. It kept producing funny moments, rarely. That's the point. 9 seasons, so many plot holes, Barney's story line, why they couldn't feel the need to emphasize more on Ted and Robin's relationship early on to avoid that Finale? Barney is the best character? are you serious, if anything Marshall was the best character, have you even heard of Dwight Schrute? George Costanza? Gob Bluth? even Chandler Bing? some loved and greatest sitcom characters of all time.\n",
      "1 \t\t Loved it , hilarious. Never relied on conventional ideas and all 5 actors shone equally with writers generous in equal parts\n",
      "Great list of extras especially as the show's popularity grew.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've been watching it for over a year and half, an episode every night, sometimes even more. Took break after every season too.However the days were after watching HIMYM the nights became somewhat legendary with laughter. It had some complex relationships, endless search for eternal love and above all the great moments between the friends.My Rating: 9.5/10.\n",
      "1 \t\t I enjoyed binge watching the last few seasons on Netflix b/c like many of you, I wanted to know who the mother was. Now that I know, watching re-runs just sucks since all of ted's romances are a big f-you until the mother who we all now know. Part of what makes a show great for me is watching re-runs and having a laugh. Now the only one that makes me laugh is barney. If you haven't seen the series, good watch. If you know the mother, then skip re-runs as it will not be as good as first time.\n",
      "1 \t\t On the positives, I loved how the actor Neil Patrick Harris totally nailed the character of Barney Stinson with his charm and energy. There were a lot of scenes which were stupid and very unrealistic mainly revolving around Barney but the actor managed to pull those off with his wit and humour making it laughable rather than lame or cringey. And not to mention about his lengen-(wait-for-it)-dary apartment. The character Ted Mosby as the protagonist was a safe play by the makers with the fact that he was the most normal one of the gang and being a hopeless romantic, yet he was adorable. The couple of the gang, Marshall and Lily gave the warm and romantic vibes to the show (also sometimes giving that boring couple vibe), while Barney balanced out that vibe with his jokes. The character Robin also added up the charm to the show, being the centre of most of the dramas and the show's twists. I loved how Tracy (the mother) enters the story, meeting each of Ted's friends, and was really charismatic. All these characters shown were quite realistic. The twists and turns were quite the essence of the show.Though I enjoyed the show throughout but there were some flaws there. First, the focus of the show. Well, the name of the show suggested the love story of Ted Mosby and 'The Mother' Tracy (even this name was revealed at the very end of the show). But instead they focused on his life with his friends (should I call it FRIENDS 2.0?). And only one season, that too with a brief role of 'the mother' was all that we were waiting for literally the whole series! And even in 9th season, they stretched the Robin-Barney wedding too much. They'd have focused more on Ted and Tracy at least for that season. I think it was kinda lack of thoughtfulness on the makers' side to go off-topic from the theme of the show. Secondly, Tracy as a character was shown way too much similar to Ted which I think was unrealistic and irrational ( eg: both liked coins, too much similarities in behaviour and style (if you noticed)). If they showed more of them having chemistry and understanding with each other (which I think would work out well), it would've been all fine.Overall, the series had great elements which kept me hooked to the show. But the last season was quite not I was looking for and the end was not very satisfying. Still, this sitcom is heartwarming, feel-good and fun.\n",
      "1 \t\t It's a series I've watched from start to finish at least 5-6 times since the first time I watched it. I laughed and cried every time I watched it. Both the main characters and the supporting characters, all the actors carried their roles very well. Especially Neil Patrick Harris (Barney) !! Every time I hear the song playing at the end of the last episode, I get emotional with a strange feeling inside. I strongly recommend this series.\n",
      "0 \t\t Generally funny show. Characters are likeable and interesting. People say the show wouldn't be successful without Neil Patrick Harris which is 100% true. Early seasons are best and the quality drops a bit in the later ones, especially the last couple.Recently binged the series and noticed some annoying things. The shows presented as a live studio audience show, the sets are designed as such but the laugh track doesnt change. Theres one stupid distinctive laugh I hear at least once every two episodes but makes a good drinking game (you know which one I mean). Also, they add the laugh track for jokes to imply an audience is there but thats all they do. No \"awws\" when something sweet happens, no gasps when something shocking occurs. If you're lying about an audience, at least try to make it look believeable. Its feels like they didn't want an audience but some studio executive from the 90s came in and demanded one.If you gotten this far through my rambling about live audiences anf thought that was a bit much, well then its time to talk about the infamous ending. What the hell were they thinking? You can't make a show that is literally titled How I Met Your Mother, spend 9 years hyping up this person, and then pull a 180 and go \"Yup, shes dead. So if thats ok with you kids, im gonna get back together with my ex girlfriend who I never really stopped thinking about despite the fact that were competely incompatible\". Also the entire final season is quite a letdown. When you're doing a 24 episode season, its best not to set all of them within a weekend, especially a wedding where you learn the marriage doesn't last. This would have been better suited for 12 episodes, 18 maximum because some of the episodes were complete timewasters.So in summary, good start, great middle, terrible ending.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show to binge watch. As it is mainly all flash backs it doesn't even have to be in order.The show is based on a very good idea: a father is telling his children how he met their mother. But this is also a pretext to speak about the relationships between five persons (at the end comes the sixth person, the mother) in New York: their moments of joy, happiness, their pains and their hopes. Another excellent idea was to include the character of Robin Scherbatsky, a young Canadian woman and there are very swet and funny scenes when the friends discover the life of Robin in Canada or when they visit a Canadian bar in New York.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show, plenty of jokes and full of humor. Episodes are shorten in to 20-25min and stories are great. Highly recommended for watch.......!\n",
      "1 \t\t This was literally the most perfect ending to anything ever. It was incredibly surreal the way it skipped through time. All these people who hate the writers, hate the ending, say they are disappointed, they do not have the imagination to enjoy the ending. Yes, the writers could have done the arbitrary. They could have made Robin and Barney happy ever after. They could have gotten through every issue they had and stayed through the long haul. But who in the world is interested in a love where they have to \"get through?\" They could have made the mother and Ted grow old and gray together, but people die. Ted was always Robin's fallback, her consolation prize. It was absolutely beautiful that in the end, Robin was Ted's second choice, his golden consolation prize. Nobody saw it coming. And no matter what kind of fan you are, I feel your desires were adequately served. Ted found his true love, the mother of his children, his wife. T.M. was the woman who he was looking for. He got to have his adventures with her. With her, he got everything he ever wanted. He got all the connection and overzealous acts of love with her. And yet, he still ended up with a wonderful woman who loved him, and a woman that some of us always half-hoped he would end up with. I don't want to say the deeper meaning to this story was to touch our hearts and teach us a loving lesson. This is a television program that we all enjoyed and looked forward to, but some of the reviewers need to stop making it a personal disappointment. The show was always wonderful, and the ending was the best part. Talk about closure. It went from a funny, lighthearted, impossibly funny show to a touching and serious story about life changes. Robin and Barney ended because sometimes, lust and trying is not enough. The mother died because sometimes pure love is definitely enough, but loved ones die, and not always at the right time. But to the writers, you could not have done it better. The only thing I am disappointed with is that the show had to end, but that was one hell of a way to go out. Bravo!\n",
      "0 \t\t I get that the show was mostly about Ted's love for Robin but having gone through all he did and finally meeting Tracy, why take her out of the equation entirely by having her die? Couldn't she have been Ted's forever after? Tracy was supposed to be the symbol that waiting for the right one totally pays off. The fact that she wasn't really thrown into the storyline defeats that purpose. Nonetheless, the show was great and was worth it.\n",
      "0 \t\t The storytelling here...falls short...it wants to be good by trying to different...it almost succeeds...but fails...the only thing going for this show...is barnie...or is it spelt bernie...can't be that would be a girl's name...however his name is spelt...he's the one that carries this showthe subversion technique is actually pretty good...tried to be good...maybe if one or two things were changed then maybe...but overall...okay...was it okay though?...watchable i guess.\n",
      "1 \t\t I know I am late watching this but still worth it anyway. Get some laughs in your everyday life and have a good cry in the last few episodes. Thank you for this good one and nine seasons.\n",
      "1 \t\t Also, I haven't watched a great sitcom since... Will & Grace I think. Or Friends. The past years in TV I've been used to the hour-long drama, so it's refreshing to watch snippy-snappy half hour laugh-a-minute sitcoms.I think what makes HIMYM particularly relatable to me is that it's about a bunch of 5 friends in the prime of their life, trying to get through love and life in the big city, which kinda sounds like what me and my friends are doing now, and a lot of the sentiment and situations seem very familiar - the search for true love, relationship woes, friends getting married, job issues... Love the opening montage of all the candid/slightly drunk photos of all the friends and the short catchy tune.But what makes the show really tick? Neil Patrick Harris, Dr Horrible himself playing the womanizer Barney Stinson. His catchphrases (here's his blog) and bro code (there's even a book now) raise the show to another level. There is no one in real life like the Barnacle, you would expect such an OTT character to be pretty annoying, but NPH strikes the right balance of absolutely ridiculous and laugh out loud hilarious, and he's a great foil against the more staid Ted. Love!I also love the set-up - the main premise of the show is about Ted Mosby in the year 2030 relating to his 2 children about how he met their mother, and he goes into a long, long, long story about the hijinks he and his group of friends got up to back in the day (2006 onwards). Past Ted begins the series witnessing his best friends Lily and Marshall getting engaged, spurring him to find his one true love and settling down. We also meet his other best friend, the philandering Barney and Robin, the woman he thinks is his one true love and ends up as one of his closest friends. As we all know, Past Ted does find his one true love eventually, and she bears him the 2 children he's dreamed of that he's telling all these stories to, but who is she? (SPOILER!) The very first episode sets it up to be Robin, but it's revealed at the end that it's not, and Future Ted makes references to Aunt Robin, so you know it's not her... (END SPOILER)All in all, fantastic show! Go catch it now! I've watched a total of 44 episodes in these 2 seasons so far, so I doubt I'm going to do a separate post for each (would kill me I'm sure), so I'll probably do it in batches. I definitely want to highlight all the various theories and my favourite quotes... Till then!\n",
      "1 \t\t About HIMYM, this is my favorite TV show ever. On the first episode, I seriously fell in love with the characters, the story, everything is amazing on this show. I watched almost 9 seasons (8 and a half) in a month, because I was so addicted to the story and if I could I would give a thousand stars for this How I Met Your Mother. Obviously, some people will disagree with my opinion, but this TV show changed my life. I couldn't stand the idea of ​​staying a day without watching HIMYM, I was completely addicted to it because the idea of the story is amazing, and some parts made me cry :P Well, I totally recommend it for everyone.\n",
      "1 \t\t From the promotional photo which graces the main page on the main IMDb entry for the show which looks just like Coupling U.K. promo material to the basic premise of three guys and three gals (one we have yet to see) hanging out at a bar/coffee place, this show is Friends all over again. Unlike last season's Coupling U.S. effort though, this one seems to work. The chemistry of the gang is credible and even Neil Patrick Harris in the role of the wealthy playboy/ladies' man works this time. This is what should have filled the Friends void instead of last year's pretender. The twist of knowing there's going to be a happy-ever-after for the dorky single guy is a good thing because nobody needs to go through years of waiting for Ross/Rachel to get on the same page all over again. The comparison to Wonder Years is a bit thin and misleading. It's only the plot device that's common not the content of the two shows. It's about three guys/gals in three different phases of their coupling development. That's always fun to watch as long as the writing stays witty.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is one of the best shows of this generation it is funny and also has characters you can relate to. It's touching story is universal and the show will go on to be a timeless classic\n",
      "0 \t\t This show is just awesome.sometimes i got a little unpacient,because it's kind of slow,but now that i have watched it,i wish it was slower 'cause i didn't want it to end.sure,the ending was a little bit disappointing for me,but explains alot,and the rest of the story makes up for it.i loved tracy's character way more than robin's and her death made me so angry,but i loved the robin-barney relationship and their divorce made it 100 times more disappointing. anyways,the tv show was legen..wait for it....keep waiting...darry!\n",
      "1 \t\t Rewatched after a couple of years and still love it. But still mad about the final season. This is not what I wanted for Ted. Robin did not deserves him. Barney either. Love all the characters, especially Robin. I am just disappointed the way the show ended. That girl gave Ted everything he dreamed of and because just a side note.\n",
      "1 \t\t Even the title says it was about meeting the mother, not finding the love of his life!\n",

      "1 \t\t If ever a climax can spoil a show...it has to be the climax of how I met your mother....all 8 seasons ...they built such a beautiful build up..to what should have been a relationship larger than life ... only to spoil it in the last episode....why writers why... spoil that perfect ending for us!!!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t A lot of criticism I will give comedy sitcoms is how predictable they are. This one though even if it is predictable (which it isn't) the characters are so wonderful. Now not wonderful as in they have blessed minds wonderful, I mean wonderful as in the characters are just people that you can just sit down and watch and laugh or just plain feel sorry for them. People hated the finale because they were so into and attached to the characters.It's about a nostalgic New Yorker who sits his kids down and tells them the story of how he pined over chicks and how their Uncle Barney did so many chicks. To be more detailed, it's about a guy well recounting the story of he aspired for a love interest and how the love interest wasn't that far away to begin with. I describe it like that because, well, it takes nine seasons to get to the part where he actually meets their mother. The kids Uncle Barney is a womanizer times 69 who bangs chicks every other day (if even other.) He is the core appeal of the show. Try watching him while keeping in mind the actor that plays him is gay. It won't cross your mind. Even when the character gets sentimental towards his main love interest you can truly feel sorry and happy for him. The love triangle revolves around him, Ted, the main character, and Robin, the \"one\" that Ted sees at first sight but is constantly told by destiny that it's not meant to be. Barney, in his lady charm, sways her over to him in the most sincere ways (well, in thought.).The other two main characters Lilly and Marshall are the definition of a not yet old old married couple. He couldn't leave her no matter how many times Barney offered to take him to the strip club. The mother character, once we get around to her, is adorable and cute and I may have a crush😚 (even if I don't do crushes.)As for the twist in the finale, yeah, it was done really sloppy. The timing was, at least. But I honestly don't hate it because that was life. SPOILER: Barney and Robin get divorced after three years, the mother dies, and Ted and Robin get back together. I don't necessarily like that, but that is kinda the point. You want people to get together and live happily ever after. Think of two people in real life you wish got together cause they were perfect. They just don't. It is sad. I don't like that they don't. The point of the finale was to make you feel that. Neil Patrick Harris did a superb job of making you believe that was Barney's turning point. My criticism: I really do feel like he had a turning point before that. The Ted meets the Mother scene was fantastic. Perhaps perfect. Ted after having a good life, with the passing of his wife, holds that nostalgic horn up to Robin and... I smiled. I didn't like that was what happened. It was the story of how love isn't a choice and perhaps you can never truly let it go.\n",
      "1 \t\t I started binging this show right after finishing Modern Family and I really liked it. Ngl the ending was a bit confusing and I think the mother deserved better but still, the loved this show so so much! I will definitely miss the cast, and bar, and all that!\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't care about what other people says. This is a great series . A lot of people thinks the ending maybe bad but it's not. Ted deserves happiness after all of that.\n",

      "1 \t\t First things first the people give this how all the bad rating do not know good comedy if it was in front of them. I love the story and all the friendships they all had. I love the story I love how Ted told them how he had all the friends.What I like that he said is what they all did this show was not dumb funny the comedy was brilliant the cast had amazing chemistry. I give this show a 10/10 when the show ends I give the show a 6/10 I love this show it was amazing but the ending should have ended with the alternate ending. Its called How I Met Your Mother but they ruined the ending by getting Ted back with Robin the people I like best in the show are\n",

      "Its hard to pick the two girls\n",
      "1 \t\t Okay. Let me start by listing out my fav bits of the show. To my memory, the show depicted two major fights between Lily and Marshall. And in those scenes, Jason Segal and Alyson Hannigon did a stellar job. There was real emotion in those scenes. Also in a very memorable Season 6, episode 13. Another one, I love how the character of Ted was written. His struggle and hope, even in the worst times of his life. Remarkable to me. Earnest acting by Radnor who really made me believe in his struggle and his never ending hope. And Finally. Neil Patrick Harris. No one can say enough of him. The portrayal of Barney Stinson on the small screen makes me wonder what will be most remembered and marked upon in years to come, the character itself or the actor who brought it to life.This isn't my fav sitcom (Friends) but this one has it moments. Certainly. It challenged the viewers, angered them, made them cry, amazed them. I don't want to get into the ending of the series. I completed it years after the alternate ending was released, it was ruined for me anyway. But I wont let the slight dampen the good times. This show really had its moments, some of them I will even admit are.. i really don't want to be doing this but .. legendary. And I say this because I will take a few bits of it with me.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show. It has humor and a great storyline. Barney is one hell of a character. They use a whole season to show Barney and Robins wedding, and in the end they use 1 episode to show everything that happens after. Ted's wife is apparently dead, and we never even got to know her properly. All of a sudden Lily is pregnant again?? Without any warning we find out that the group is not even friends anymore? The whole show builds up to the fact that we're supposed to ship Barney and Robin, and in the end they get a divorce? Just so Ted can get together with her, because he has apparently always been in love with her?? Was he still in love with her when he was together with his wife?? What a jerk. If I could change anything, it would be the ending. It's like a big middle finger in your face after watching 9 good seasons. No thanks.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show has a lot of issues, with the main character Ted just barely being the worst. He's obsessive when it comes to Robin, in an unhealthy way, and every other relationship he's had since meeting her have ended because of this obsession. It's hard to meet 'the right one' when he won't allow himself to forget Robin. Luckily the writers had a solution for that when it came to the actual mother: kill her off. In a 15 second scene where they don't bother to explain what's going on (because, let's face it, Tracy actually looks healthy lying in that hospital bed), they completely destroy everything they've worked up to for years just so Ted can finally be awarded for continously screwing up everything in his life for a woman whom he finds too independent and who's never wanted kids. Guys, just because she comes to visit him & his kids to have dinner, does not equal wanting kids. If she wanted kids, she would've had them with whatever guy came after Barney.Now that we're at Barney: Whatever the writers were thinking, it wasn't anything good. They wanted a womanizer and instead created a monster with daddy issues so deeply disturbing that not even marrying Robin could get rid of it. Because of course there was a divorce and he's lost all his hope in love because of that. Like, dude, go see a shrink you don't bang in the end. The many conquests achieved through ridiculous lies may seem funny if you look at it superficially, but even then it's just a way to portray how stupid women can be and how easily they're seduced if there's a 'hot guy' involved. To anyone who thinks that Barney is the way to treat the other sex: don't ever talk to the other sex.Honestly I could go on and on about the problems with each individual character, but I'll leave you to rewatch the episode where Robin's ex-psychiatrist shares what he thinks of the group and leave it at that.If you believe in true love and romance, I highly suggest you don't watch this show. Unless you want to get an idea of how to turn love into a disturbing obsession, then go for it of course.\n",
      "1 \t\t I will have laughed three times in all the show... overrated.\n",
      "1 \t\t Excellent overall storyline and great storytelling in the later seasons (4+) covers for some bad acting and cringe in the earlier seasons.\n",
      "1 \t\t They pretty much copied Friends. The actors and actresses weren't as good and that ending sucked. I actually liked this show when I started watching it live around season 3 but after watching Friends all the way through on Netflix I am disappointed in this show and any millennial who thinks this show is so great.\n",
      "1 \t\t There's very few endings in Television that are such.an absolute trainwreck that they not only sour me to the story, but turn what were previously wonderful memories of a joy filled laughing time with friends enjoying a story like this to something that I can't even crack a smile at the best scenes of the series going.One of them is this show, How I Met Your Mother, and others have given this series high praise for the quality of the comedy, acting and development of the series, and in all due respect I have no understanding of why people are willing to do this.We now know that those first words spoken during the opening episode and the reaction of the kids to 'Aunt Robin' lead to the 'you're in love with Aunt Robin, Dad.' and then a complete repeat of the same scene from the start of the series.Every moment, from. Victoria, Stella, Zoey Jeanette.or Becky, all of them are worthless, because 'Ted actually still loves Robin'Heck even marrying Tracy is ruined as the point is 'Ted actually still loves Robin' he doesn't ACTUALLY love Tracy, he's 'Settling' for Tracy, a woman who shares all his interests, is as goofy as he is and as kind as he is, is his perfect partner who he is comfortably with and perfectly able to be with without fear of judgement.Because 'He still loves Robin' it ruins everything. The car crash of Barney's relationship with Robin outside of this is enough, they spend years building up to a marriage that has been shown to be a cemented good thing for both of them as they can be happy together as they're like Ted and Tracy, they compliment each other rather than overshadow each other, only for it to break down within a year or two for him to cheat on her and for him to become the same womaniser as he always was - while still being a good dad though.That ending ruined everything about this series - at least for me - and made it one of the few series I cannot even bring myself to try and watch again if I ever see it, because it's neither worth it or good enough to be tolerated anymore.\n",
      "1 \t\t As a fan of \"Friends\" too, I don't care that there are so much similarities between these two. First, I saw \"Friends\", and it became my favorite tv show. I saw it at least two times, and then I started just to put it on tv as a \"background noise\". I still laugh/cry at some scenes after so much time. And that's why I can't choose between these two: \"Friends\" was the first favorite tv show, but \"HIMYM\" is more alike my life. Or more alike the life and the friends I would like to have. As Barney would say \"Hanging out at a coffee place: not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.\" Well, I'd like to drink my \"hangover-fixer elixir\" in my favorite coffee shop after I spend the night at my favorite bar :)\n",
      "1 \t\t What does a Friends Fanatic think of how I met your mother? Let's find out!I love this show, even though it's kind of a friends rip-off, it's great. But it has some issues. First of all since we know that for say Robin isn't the mother we know that their relationship wont hold. But in Friends when we look at Chandler and Monica it becomes exiting because we dont know if their relationship will break. Anyway this show is great but I am personally a Friends Fanatic.7/10\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is smart, funny and most of all intelligent (without being intellectual or highbrow). Like the show that precedes it, THE BIG BANG THEORY, it reflects the type of friendships and bonding that happens only when one is in their twenties, before kids and PTA's and politics and family. So much television is centered on the adolescent market, seeing young adults on these shows is as refreshing and they are hysterically funny. I truly hope that neither of these shows are hurt by the writers strike. Just watching them takes this middle aged man back to a different time in one life. And it is nice to see that things are pretty much the same for young people as they were thirty years ago. Rumor has it that they are thinking about canceling it. CBS PLEASE LET IT LIVE!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t So the show starts good. Barney is the greatest character and brough quite some tricks tweaks in the show. Some rituals all the history lessons, interesting. Ending is very good. Narrative and intelligent. But the thing that is missing is LAUGHS. This is not a sitcom it is just a long story and not even interesting. I haven't laughed once whilst watching this show. Not once!\n",

So onto the good bits; well there are only 2: The first is Barney. Pretty much the only great thing about this series and the reason why I sat it out until the end of Series 1... so yeah thanks Neil Patrick Harris for allowing me to sit through the mediocrity with moments of your awesome. The second is probably not that great if you're not a guy; yep it's Robin. Cobie is beautiful (disclaimer: in the context of Series 1). I don't mean in the whole phwoar I'd like some of that way; I mean in the wow let's be friends and introduce you to my mother kinda way.So, to summarize: Ted = Ross, Robin = Rachel, Lily = Monica, Marshall = Gunther, Barney = LE-GEN-DARY!\n",

How i met your mother and used her til i could finally get the women i truly love, robin. It was a fun ride for the viewers but the end really did ruin it. The Barney and Robin season long wedding was a waste of time as just as quick as their wedding ended, they were broke up. As the writers felt it would be better to show robin as a heartless shrew who only cares about her career and herself. If you have never seen the show and do not care about my spoilers. Watch it up to the Wedding and than turn it off and say the end. Least than you wont be left disappointed at what could have been. Including a spin off of the mother from the show. Who came on strong and was wonderfully played by Cristin Milioti. All actors/ actresses did a excellent job on this show, the writers just screwed it up. Plain and simple. 10/10 before the series ending. Lose 5 stars for that train wreck of an ending.\n",

      "1 \t\t Well first off I just wont to say I think this is an amazing show! It has a super good cast and a scripd you can't go wrong with. I can't wait for season 4.One of my fav things about the show is that in some ways It's getting back to the basics. It is one of the only (good) shows these days that has a laugh track, and I think in some ways that makes it a better show. I think that with all the new kinds of T.V. shows out there right now It's sorta nice to be able to just toon in to an HIMYM eppy, not need to know what the plot is right then and just be able to laugh.Anyway if you ever have some free time, watch the Show!\n",
      "0 \t\t --------- WATCH OUT, it contains SPOILERS. -----------------it's probably the best comedy show ever for the first 4, maybe 5 seasons. funny, smart, intriguing. the idea of a story told by a father to his children about how he met their mother is original and amazingly funny. and you can really relate to the main character if you are a guy in your late 20ies or 30-something and you don't just want to settle, but are just looking very hard for the woman of your dreams.but the show gets worse and worse from the sixth season on. at some point, we lose track of the characters' lives. their job like disappears and they are mainly involved in stupid gags you would find old and stupid even in a show of 30 years ago. the only exception is barney, the only character that the screenwriters take seriously from the fifth season. at some point during the seventh season, i told myself that i was going to watch this show till the end for the sole purpose of knowing who the heck is the mother and how the \"father\" met her and how the fell in love with each other. which is basically NOT shown if not partially, the screenwriters sort of forget to explain and show the whole thing the way it would have deserved to be shown.the last season is the worst, BY FAR. let's just draw a veil over the veeeeery low budget, which shows itself way more than it should. it entirely revolves on barney's wedding or, to be more exact, the last 48 hours before the wedding. and what about the main character? well, he almost becomes a caricature. and the mother we waited for for so long? over more than 200 hundred episodes, we only get to see her for like 20 minutes or maybe less.my advice is: watch the first 5 seasons, then skip to the last two episodes. then watch what is in between, but don't expect much. and don't wait for the mother, you will see her very rarely despite being in the title of the show.sorry for my bad English. this is my first review, I needed to say my opinion about this show because it really let me down.\n",

      "0 \t\t My wife and I have only watched two television series from start to finish: \"Friends\" and \"How I Met Your Mother\". Usually, we discard a hugely popular series for one reason or another...\"Reba\" when the writing went bad by converting Cheyenne into a closet alcoholic\"NCIS\" we should have bailed out when Ellie Bishop joined the team--she's horrible--but we persisted until the current season 13; we've stopped watching in anticipation of Gibbs compromising his principles by shaking hands with a dirtball.\"MasterChef\" we've left multiple seasons in more than one country before selection of the final winner whenever the rigged judging became too much to swallow.NOT with \"How I Met Your Mother\". Thoroughly enjoyable from S01E01 through S09E23/24. I am amazed that the writers could produce so much fresh material and so many funny jokes about sex--sorry, \"relationships\". Often, during the series, I would say to my wife, \"Ready to watch some more family porn?\" :-)Complaints:1. I only disliked one episode, Trilogy Time (S07E20); the repeatedly-jumping-around time frame nearly gave me a headache.2. Twice during the series, I tired of Ted's constant stream of relationships, saying \"I wish this show would move forward\". Hence, my 9/10 rating.\n",
      "0 \t\t Last episode was awful. Very bad ending. I am disappointed. Whole series was very good, but ending in last episode ruined everything. It was not strong and powerful enough and I do not see any deeper message. I do not see why writers introduced Tracy when she has not done anything important for the show. I also do not see why the whole show is named \"How I Met Your Mother\" when the mother is not so important character. I do not understand what this show taught us and what lesson we should learn. I do not want to offend anyone but I simply do not know how such a good series can end in such a bad way.\n",
      "1 \t\t Seinfeld, Friends and Frazier ended their legendary run and How I Met Your Mother started theirs, the show has originality which is something the sitcoms have needed since the great three ended and this is one of the greatest sitcom cast i have seen in a while Neil Patrick Harris is hilarious as Barney Stinson, NPH, Alysan Hanningan and Jason Segal are not new to the business and know how to make people laugh their ass off but the virtually unknown Josh Radnor and Cobie Smolders are the ones who i really like have the most challenging job in the show .Obviously the guy who has the most entertaining material to work with is NPH, his job is being an obnoxious womanizer that things the world goes around him(The Best Job In The World?). How I Met Your Mother is one of the most hilarious and sharpest show on TV right now and will hopefully be for a long time. It's not all comedy it has a bit of a story. It's not about nothing like the other legendary shows, this one has a goal to reach and if something it makes it more entertaining, LEGEN...wait for it......DARY!!!!!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t It used to be the favorite show I have ever saw. And the first 6 seasons still are and i can watch those over and over again and never stop laughing. The brilliant quotes of Barney, Ted hopelessly falling in love, Marshall's stupidity together with Lily and then you have Robin, who also had some superb moments. Then it was just the 5 of them mostly sitting in the bar having hilarious adventures. I remember when i first watched the whole show i just wanted to watch the whole thing again and so i did. When i think about it now i almost want to skip season 7 and 8. There are still some very good episodes but it's just not as funny as it used to be.I'm not going to give this show 1 star because the last 2 seasons were less good and i don't understand anyone who does. It's not because 1 or maybe 2 seasons are less good, that instantly the whole show is bad. This show is still very good and even more then very good in the first couple of seasons and it's true that it has weakened, but give it 1 star just for that is just not a trustworthy rating.The biggest problem i have with the last 2 seasons is that Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) has lost his touch in the show. For a lot of people he's the biggest reason they watch this show. He's still a brilliant actor but \"no one\" wants him to be in love on this show. He was the player of the bunch and that's just how it's supposed to be. I also think Ted is also not as funny as he was and the same counts for Lily. For me the only constantly good character is Marshall (Jason Segel).But it's a very good sitcom and the most awesome scenes I have ever watched are in this show. The car scene with Barney and Ted is just the best scene ever! I've never laughed that hard in my life. I think How i met your mother is a must watch for everyone who likes comedy. It's an iconic show and still one of the best there is!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is up there as one of the greatest shows of all time and proves that with every breathtakingly beautiful episode produced.The storytelling was brilliant. Each episode contained a unique story about Ted Mosby and the gang and sometimes ties in with previous stories told. The end to each story salivates you enough that you want to come back for more.The character development is off the charts as we see each character grow tremendously throughout the series.\n",
      "Marshall and Lily realise that they aren't a perfect couple, but that's ok because no matter what they go through their love for one another keeps them together.\n",

      "Barney learns how to love again and is willing to throw away his pimping lifestyle to be with one woman\n",
      "Ted for the longest time believed in destiny and finding that one and only woman and gets to a point where he realises this may not be possible and he is ok with that.Each and every episode was as exciting as the one before, so what went wrong? Quite simply, the ending.One of the reasons that the fans tuned back to another episode every week (apart from the gripping storytelling) was because they were excited to be on this journey of discovery to find out who the mother was that Ted would finally end up with. We witnessed Ted meeting woman after woman and it constantly went wrong and we resonated with that and wanted to see him succeed. And he finally did when he met Tracy. We were all so excited for this moment. On top of this we got to see Robyn and Barney get married and seeing Ted move on from this was awesome and it made us feel like \"yes, everyone gets a happy ending\" but it went downhill from here.The writers decided to divorce Robyn and Barney after 2 seasons of build up to their wedding and kill off Ted's wife after every single episode was leading to this point.Just a quick sidebar, knowing what we know about the ending, the writers did put in some pretty epic foreshadowing to the death in previous episodes such as when Ted pictures in his mind going to Tracy's apartment and telling her with tears in his eyes how he wished he could spend more time with her.By the end of it, yes it was nice that Ted finally got together with Robyn, but this was something we wanted 6 seasons ago or at least in a different way. This is why the ending is bitter sweet because while we get that ONE moment of slight peace, it wasn't how it should have ended. The ending should have been one final shot of Lily and Marshall, Ted and Tracy, Robyn and Barney, all still happily married, sitting having an awesome time at McLarrens pub. That in my eyes would have been a more satisfying and justifiable ending.\n",

      "0 \t\t The character Ted should kill himself. He's a whiny little b*tch and ruins practically every episode with his incessant complaining. In real life there is no way Ted would have even have four friends. Everyone would hate him. In fact, I'm pretty sure his kids do. The reason why he can't hold down a girlfriend is because he doesn't have any balls and its basically two chicks in the relationship. At this point, I couldn't care less how he meets his wife because I'm sure their marriage is going to end in a murder-suicide. The character Barney is the only reason to watch this show. Without him, the series would have been cancelled years ago.\n",
      "0 \t\t Episode #78 (I think) They talk about looking at an internet site that has a dog sh---ing on a baby? Are you kidding me? That's disgusting, cruel and the kind of profound cynicism I don't want to see on prime time sitcoms (nor do I want to explain it to my young child). In fact I'd like to see the dog sh-- on whoever came up with that line and whoever thought it was good idea next...Now I can't watch the show anymore since that's my only form of protest. Come on writers, producers, network execs!!! I never thought of myself a prude but do we really need any more of this general sh-- (no pun intended) on television? Is there no sense of human decency anymore? There a million disgusting internet things you could dream up without involving abuse to a baby (again: an innocent baby?... Y'all are seriously f--ked up!) -- some of them MIGHT EVEN BE FUNNY or involve voluntary participants. Note: stomach-churning gross does not make you edgy and isn't a shortcut to brilliance. The show isn't a farcical or surreal tone so am I expected to remotely relate to a somewhat realistic character that could be entertained by witnessing filmed abuse to a helpless baby -- ugh!! ...and more importantly: NOT F---ing FUNNY!!\n",
      "1 \t\t I started watching this show out of inertia - not bothering to change channels after getting my Kevin James/Leah Remini fix (King of Queens). I didn't expect to like it since I'm an older viewer and it seemed to be directed towards a younger demographic.Instead, I found a funny, sweet, intelligent show with characters whom I really LIKE...a lot, actually. Even Barney, who is like every conceited creep you've ever met, is charming in his overblown, irritating way, and he's the most hilarious part of the show.I adore Ted. He makes me wish I'd met someone like him when I was younger. His irrational picky-ness about who he falls in love with is the main storyline in the show, but all the other characters have their own stories to tell. I love Robin, who is gorgeous and smart and funny while trying to start her career in TV. I love Lily and her fiancé, who are the epitome of a young couple in love and trying to mesh their lives and personalities.Watch the show. If you're smart, you won't regret it.\n",
      "0 \t\t Wastage of time , just dragged the story . After season 4 there was lame comedy. Lily Aldrin worst actress i have ever seen.\n",
      "1 \t\t I can't begin to describe how in awe I am of HIMYM. I've watched every episode multiple times. The writing was once-in-a-generation amazing. The acting was excellent. None of the other, less obvious work that goes into making a show, like set design, wardrobe, lighting, music, etc detract, so they must have been good too.The show inevitably draws comparisons to \"Friends\", a show that I've also seen every episode of multiple times. I would describe Friend's writing/plots/storylines as typically much simpler and basic (but also well done). HIMYM's writing/plots/storylines were often incredibly complex, seamlessly weaving together multiple threads with surprise twists, interesting jumps in time or place, and callbacks to past episodes that had me wondering how much of the later season shows they had pre-planned from the start, versus craftily writing later episodes to make it appear that way. The anti-hero, flawed but not completely unredeemable (especially given his childhood backstory), Barney character was genius. He was perfect for instigating comedic moments, and for spicing up stories with crazy activities. Robin Sparkles and other Robin backstory episodes are some of my favorites, that had me doubled-over laughing.I think the only criticisms I can find to make are: 1) Sometimes it rips off Friends. Not frequently, but often enough to comment on it. At times it is subtle, at times it is blatant. Usually they do a good job of putting a twist on it to make it their own though. I can't really fault them too much though, given that both shows ran for such a long time, and had such similar premises. It was bound to happen. 2) the Britney Spears guest appearance was awful. 3) It was a bit lacking in POC, especially for a show set in NYC, though Barney's brother, played by comedy god Wayne Brady, was great to see. 4) I hate the opening piano music. Some have complained about the ending, and even the entire final season. In the final season, I thought Marshall's trip across half the country got very tedious, but unlike others, I thought the Farhampton weekend spread out through many episodes was actually brilliantly done. Ted was finally meeting the titular mother of his children, and in recounting it to his children, every event of that weekend would have mattered to him. The events were well-written, and I didn't feel like the show suffered at all from the slowdown in time. The ending got a lot of complaints because it had some sadness in it rather than a fairy tale ending. I kind of had the same negative reaction at first, but it grew on me, and now I see it as realistic, interesting, and well thought out. My only complaint was that I didn't think Robin ever deserved a second chance from Ted, and didn't see why he was so hung up on a woman who was so wrong for him, especially later in life when he was older and wiser, which usually means less tolerance for incompatibility. Maybe one or both of them changed, and they became more compatible, but that wasn't shown.\n",
      "0 \t\t I've always hated the idea of Ted & Robin together (never really liked the character Ted in itself to be fair) so ending thing like they did really ruined an otherwise decent show for me.\n",
      "1 \t\t Like almost all shows, this one started Ok, got real good, but the last season, I just watched it because I had to, I just didn't enjoy it that much.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is My All Time Favourite Show\n",
      "1 \t\t This show was by far the best show I have ever watched, from it's humor to it's emotional connection you develop towards the characters. It has the perfect combination of both humor and emotion that a sitcom has ever had along with outstanding writing. The 5 main actors have outstanding performances that don't show a slight dip in quality through the entire run of the show. But season 9 takes a different turn from the usual as the entire season has a different setting and a shorter period (but same amount of episodes). But little warning...the ending is complete trash and is not the ending the characters really deserve. But it's only these 2 episodes that are a disappointment and should not judge the show based on that.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show.The destruction of the Arcadian however got me so frustrated that I had to stop watching. You can't root for the good guys anymore when they commit such cultural terrorism.\n",

      "1 \t\t \"...is not something that develops over time. It is something that happens instantaneously. It courses through you like the water of a river after a storm, filling you and emptying you all at once.

      "1 \t\t Piece of sh..., I didn'l like it at all. I watched it because my friends said its like friends... oooooh shut up. Its not even close. Its the wprst ever. The people kept watching it because they are curious to know the mother not for comedy or anything else and to be honest she appeared at the last season and it was the only funny season.\n",
      "1 \t\t They undid all the character developments Barney had in only just 2 last episodes, Ted never learned how to move on. They should just delete the last 3 minutes from the existence of this universe. Until that moment it was a great show. The storytelling was the best at it's peak momemts. Loved Lily and Marshall's chemistry.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show because I like the idea of men looking for love. I also like Jason Segel, Neil Patrick Harris, and Cobie Smoulders, who was Agent Hill from the Avengers.\n",
      "1 \t\t OK I just watched the finale and I'm thinking a lot about it. So this review is gonna be in 2 parts. The first talking about the finale on it's own, then talking about my overall thoughts on the show.1. The Finale My response to the finale itself is \"meh\". I found it kind of redundant that Barney and Robin split up right after the entire season being dedicated to their wedding. My other problem (and this is a huge problem) is that Ted decides to get back together with robin at the end. Now, I know Ted will always love his wife who has passed on, but this kind of undermines what I feel the whole point of the show was. Ted trying to find the woman he would spend the rest of his life with and never stop loving even after she passes. And I know that he still loves her but that doesn't really work here. Have it end with their wedding or something and don't have this huge overarching storyline that goes into the future. It seems to me what they were trying to do was satisfy everybody. And that's impossible. You gotta really do what you as a writer personally want to see happen. And if this truly was what their vision was, then I think they failed to realize what the show was about and failed to execute their idea in the most satisfying way possible. I did like the thing with Barney becoming a dad and becoming responsible. That was cool. Overall I didn't have problems with it until the stupid ending where he goes to get robin. I really do like the actress who plays the Mother. I thought she and Ted had really great chemistry. Talking about overall feelings on the last episode, because of the sloppy writing and execution it leaves you with a sour taste in the mouth. The finale on it's own deserves a 6/10 from me.2. The Show But what about the show as a whole? Well, I really liked it. I thought it really had character development and relationships down to a science. You get to now these characters so well you feel as if you're part of the gang. The writing could get a little sloppy at times, and this past season was really drawn out and just unnecessary for the most part. Some episodes were better than others, but I think overall it told the story in a mostly satisfying manor. I had some problems over the years, but I think it's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. 8/10.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I decided to watch it last year I had no idea how good is it ... and I started watching it .... last thing I know after 5ep I was in love with this damn serial ..\n",

      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother, or HIMYM is something I've been addicted to since the past 5 years. It was also the first TV show I ever saw! The episodes are all VERY well constructed, with, in it's 9 year life, only some, 2 to 3 in fact, flaws in the show. But these flaws were forgotten as amazing episodes preceded them! The stories had drama, laughter, and love in each episode. HIMYM has something that the other shows don't, and that is unanswered questions. I mean, a lot of that. The show keeps you in stitches for the whole time, making it amazing. There is almost everything one wishes in a TV show in this program. OVERALL: THE BEST SHOW EVER: 10/10!\n",
      "0 \t\t I started to watch How I Met Your Mother at the start of 2012. I binge watched 6 seasons in 2 months, and I really liked it.Over the past year, I have been liking How I Met Your Mother less and less. Whenever I watch a rerun of an older episode, I rarely find it funny. I think that most of the comedy in the show is very cheap and rarely makes me laugh, and if I do, its always a very forced and not a genuine one. Does anyone else feel this? Sure, there are about 10 or 20 episodes that I really like and I still find funny, but to be honest, most of the episodes have really predictable and unfunny jokes.I've come to the conclusion that I only watched HIMYM for the storyline, without realizing that I never really found the comedy funny.And now, after waiting for the ending for 2 and a half years, I'm bitterly disappointed and feel like I've been tricked into watching something that acted like it knew where it was going, but just made up stuff along the way, and then the writers realized it would too hard to wrap up everything together, and just killed off the mother instead.The whole point of HIMYM is to tell a long story with lots of little clues along the way, and at the end, everything would be all wrapped up together nicely. But, now I feel that the show is absolute rubbish. It has annoying and unfunny comedy that only gives off cheap laughs, and the whole 9 seasons of the show leading up to Ted's mother, was a complete and utter waste of time.I'm trying to figure out how I'll rate the show out of ten. Although I don't like the comedy and plot, I do love, in particular, the first 2 seasons of the show. I think that they are the best and each episode from those seasons were well-thought out, and, as cheesy as it sounds, they were inspiring in there own special way. After that, it basically Robin-Barney on again off again, blah blah blah, and a bunch of annoying girls that Ted dated, which we all knew weren't going to be the mother.I'm going to give HIMYM a 4/10 rating. I really liked the first and second season and some other episodes from other seasons, but overall, the last few seasons really let me down, the same old story lines with the Barney-Ted-Robin love triangle bored me, the cheap laughs, the crappy finale... 4/10 is generous for me.But if you disagree with any of my points, please email me at upcauseway@gmail.com.\n",
      "1 \t\t If you think FRIENDS is better than HIMYM..\n",
      "then you are really bummed out to accept the truth that FRIENDS IS OVERRATED AND IT'S BORING ... HIMYM is fresh with much more comedy and emotions.. IT NEVER LOSES GRIPS AND IT LEAVES YOU WITH TEARS...\n",
      "1 \t\t After a couple months watching this day in and day out I am gutted that I finished it today! A wonderful show from start to finish with witty comedy and amazing stories throughout.Of course every season had its good and bad moments and I felt the final two episodes were rushed a little bit overall a great show that has filled and then left a hole in my life.Not sure what to watch now but what a show from start to finish!\n",
      "1 \t\t Bottom line: I love this show. I have been following it for so long and have been dying to figure out who the mother is. The finale last night was a great ending in my opinion. It answered the questions that most people have about a TV show; what happens later? Which we found out last night. It was upsetting to find out that the mother had passed away being that her and Ted had kids together and got along so well. But, I was completely shocked about Barney and Robin getting divorce and Ted going back to Robin. Although, I think I would have preferred Ted staying with Tracy. Also, it was amazing to see how much Barney changed after meeting his daughter.\n",
      "1 \t\t Absolutely loved this show after finally binging through it 6 years later. The character development, the humor, and the plot twists were all fantastic. I loved every move they made...until the final episode.SPOILERS BELOW9 seasons of build-up just to kill off the mother? Are you kidding me? Tracy and Ted deserve each other. They are perfect for each other and I love their relationship. Then it just ends. It's like Tracy was never there and Ted runs back to freaking Robin. Robin is the worst and she does not deserve Ted. Only Tracy deserved Ted.This is on par with the ending of Lost\n",
      "0 \t\t Despite the slightly disappointing ending and the boredom in the last parts of the series..\n",
      "this show is the kind that will stick in your memory forever..\n",
      "1 \t\t One of the best sitcoms. Many people say that they don't like the ending but you have to accept the fact that changes happen in your life. Some Changes happen gradually but surely changes will happen in your life. It was fault of the director's and writer's too that they made some huge changes in the last 2 episodes.\n",
      "1 \t\t Copying jokes and ideeas from Friends and other comedy series. Twisted and twisted a little more. Why???\n",
      "1 \t\t Favorite show. Really fun minus Ted and the last season. If you watch Friends and HIMYM enough you will see almost identical storylines, episodes, and characters(literally same actors playing different roles).You will enjoy.\n",
      "0 \t\t Okay, so I started to watch it because I really love sitcoms and HIMYM was on Disney +, so why not give it a try !I really loved this show, the fact that it's Ted that explain to his kid (and us) the story about how he met their mother, let them be creative. For example by giving saying that Ted forgot the name of one of the girl that he spent times with and calling her « Blah blah » it's really fun imo.And sometimes with that, they tricked me. For example when Ted explain that this character « did that » or at least that it is what they should have done but they did that (huge mistake) instead.The end was really good and I really advice you to watch it, if you likes sitcoms !\n",
      "1 \t\t The first 4-5 seasons were enjoyable and worth watching. But after that it got boring. Everytime older ted said \"Kids...\",\"In the spring of....\",\"On new year's eve......\",\"You remember.....\" in the final few seasons,it felt like a sting to me.Honestly,I think they took it too far.Speaking of the characters,Barney was my favourite. He cracked jokes at inappropriate times like Chandler(from Friends) and had a one-night-stand reputation like Joey(from Friends).So they managed to pull off making a character inspired from both Chandler and Joey in the same show pretty successfully,I think.Other characters were enjoyable too except Robin Scherbatsky. I personally feel,Robin managed to screw the show over and over again,at least for me.I mean one moment she wants Ted,the next moment she wants Barney. One moment she wants to get married the next moment she wants to run away!\n",
      "Finally,about the series finale-\n",
      "A complete mess! They managed to screw it over every way possible. After watching it I was like seriously?! They literally killed off the mother with just one dialogue,Barney and Robin got divorced in a single scene! And I said earliar,Robin screwed the series over and over again and this was her one last time.\n",
      "Still I liked Barney's jokes,his crazy ways of picking up girls,his crazy rules,Marshall and Lily's weird and unbreakable relationship,Ted's red cowboy boots and of course the slap bet.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the best comedy ever! I love this show. I love the plots, I love the actors, I love the setting I love the music, I basically love every single thing about this series. I have been watching the series ever since season one and I still cannot stop watching it and I am never sick of watching it. I literally laughed hysterically every time I watch the series even when I watched an episode that I have seen before. And another great thing about this series is that it's not only funny but its great in so many ways. I don't only laugh when watching this show but I also cry- I cried when marshall's dead died and when my Marshall and lily's baby was born. LolI am very curious of who the mother really is but frankly I really don't want this series to end. And the fact that the series is on it's 8th season already, is scaring me. I cannot stop watching and I don't want to stop watching because I already feel attached to the actors and the movie itself.\n",
      "1 \t\t 1st off, i enjoy how i met your mother.Good story lines and some good twists.i like the subtle humor it has at times.that being said, here's some thoughts i got on the show that are negative.1. barney's awesomes are getting kind of sickening, it's to much.2. barney's wait for it comments make me cringe, too much.3. robins character is getting annoying, she went from the 'smart' girl to the neurotic.4. ted's narrating is old, time to lessen it up.5. lily's character needs to be expanded to show her world mor.6. marshall's character also should show more of his work life segments that can tie to story lines.forget any marriages or kids, they will ruin the show. i think marshall and lily lost sexual chemistry and interest since they got married.HIMYM is a good show, but beware of the repetitious things that will bore people.\n",
      "1 \t\t Simply superb. Each season gets better and better. The main cast all have different personalities and it makes for good viewing. It's well made and quite clever.\n",
      "1 \t\t I highly recommend everyone to watch How I Met Your Mother, it's an amazing TV Show and personally one of my favorites. It has so many smart jokes that just make you laugh like crazy, its concept is great and smart and every episode's plot is just simple, clever and great. How I Met Your Mother is a heartwarming and hilarious TV show. Once you watch one episode, you'l definitely show interest on watching another one, and once you watch another episode, you definitely show interest on watching all the other episodes, what makes me call How I Met Our Mother an addiction, well, a fantastic addiction. Easily my 3rd or 2nd favorite TV Show.Characters:Ted: Ted is a very interesting character, it was very well created and amazingly played by Josh Radnor. Ted is the main character and I think that was a good choice, Ted is mature guy and also a very funny guy. I love the character and the performance.Marshall: Marshall is one of the best characters on the show, it was amazingly created and amazingly played by Jason Segel, he played a man who rarely gets a job or a responsibility. I loved Marshall (Segel) in here, he already made me laugh a lot.Barney: Barney is great, Barney is a very interesting character played by Neil Patrick Harris, who's great at his role. Barney is a womanizer that doesn't own the word 'love' on his dictionary.Lily: Lily is fantastic, Lily is an extremely interesting character about a normal teacher that also has the tendency to do stupid things, Lily was fantastically well-played by the fantastic Alyson Hannigan (American Pie) and Lily is one of the TV show's best characters.Robin: Robin is great, very well-played by Cobie Smulders, Robin is a very interesting character, who's funny and not only.Theme song:The theme song was great and it always leave us excited for the music to start, I loved the theme song and I think it was very well composed.How I Met Your Mother's Script/Concept:Placed in 2030, Ted is a father who tells his daughter and son how he met his mother by mentioning almost his entire life next to crazy stuff, dangerous stuff and good stuff, always accompanied by his great friends, Marshall, Barney, Lily and Robin.Overall, How I Met Your Mother is a fantastic TV show, it has an amazing cast, amazing characters, an amazing script and every episode is just clever, well-written, hilarious and loaded of great laughs and entertainment. This is currently one of the best TV Shows on TV right now. I consider it my 2nd or 3rd favorite TV show, cause every episode is just an overdose of entertainment, fun and laughs... big laughs. I highly recommend this show, I hope it never ends.\n",
      "1 \t\t Loved it rewatching it all again! It still plays. It still made me laugh out loud so many many times! Great cast. Great humor. Great show!\n",
      "1 \t\t While the show is wonderfully funny and should be watched by anyone who likes humor - this is really a comment about the DVD boxed set for Season 1.The box set was released soon after the premiere of Season 2 here in the US, and was snatched up by many early adopters who found out (to their dismay) that they only get 80% of the show.That is right - the Widescreen, HD-shot TV show is released on DVD in Pan and Scan, and in normal resolution. So not only do we lose quality; they also chopped off 10% of the screen to the left and right of the center in each episode.Barring those issues, the commentary, and special features were worth the price - but I'll keep the episodes on my TIVO to watch in full widescreen, thanks anyways.\n",
      "1 \t\t I'm not gonna say how great this show is, anyone who has watched it would already know that. The performances were incredible, especially NPH's, I am speechless. In fact I wanna mention one of the most memorable and illuminating scenes. It was one episode where the gang was having dinner just a few days after Stella left Ted at the altar, and they saw Stella was there too at the restaurant so they went under the table. I really like the ending of that episode, where Ted had an epiphany after seeing how great Stella and Tony were as a couple, even though he intended to give a cold and brutal speech. Ted said, sometimes you think you have to choose between running away and confrontation, but there's a third option, and that is to let it go, and only when you do that, can you truly get closure and move on. That episode blew my mind! And the entire show was filled with great stories like that. That's why I'm crazy about this show!\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't why people are upset with the ending even though it's shocking. The whole show is about how Ted and Robin are struggling to fall in love. It totally make sense.\n",
      "1 \t\t All the lead characters - Josh Radnor,Jason Segel,Cobie Smulders,Neil Patrick Harris,Alyson Hannigan have very well timing amongst them and.Specially Alyson Hannigan has a talent and improving with each episode.Neil Patrick Harris is a gemini person who is perfect cast for the character of Barney Stinson.Gemini, the sign of the Twins, is dual-natured, elusive, complex and contradictory thus Neil Patrick Harris has given his full output to it.I saw whole series on DVD and eager to find out who's teds destiny I give it 09 out of 10 as u can get addicted to it....Just don't lose chance to watch it :)\n",
      "1 \t\t \"How I Met Your Mother\" is a ride. It's a sitcom that checks off all the boxes, characters you grow to love, and jokes and stories that are both entertaining and iconic. The main cast is absolutely fantastic, and the side character's that come in and out over time compliment the main cast very well. The added elements here- that of the mystery of who the mother is and the really poignant dramatic undertones (that eventually turn into overtones) are, for the most part, very successful. That being said, the show has drawbacks. The laugh track is sometimes distractingly fake, the plot lines can sometimes be repetitive and predictable, and there are some minor inconsistencies that can be really distracting. The last season is also, objectively, the worst one, and that's quite a large disappointment (WHAT IS WITH THAT GREEN SCREEN LIKE SERIOUSLY?). That being said, this show is still so worth your time. The acting, particularly from Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan, Neil Patrick Harris, and Cobie Smulders is phenomenal, some of the best performances I've ever seen on television. They play all types of moods and styles while maintaining their characters very well, they are at home in these characters. Character pulls this through. You really grow to love these five, and you want to see them do well and succeed, despite their shortcomings and mistakes. Give 'How I Met Your Mother' a binge watch, I highly recommend it. 8.0/10\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother, is the best comedy I've seen come out ever since Friends vanished from our TV's. The story lines are very creative and the humor is real. First of all we got Ted who's the typical centered dude trying to settle down with a family, but he's eventually goofy and funny. His best friend, Marshal, who's plays the looser-ish roommate, his wife, Lilly, who's voice of wisdom for everybody but never leaving her humor behind. The pretty/funny girl Robin, who's also kind of a tomboy. And Last, but definitely not least the foolish, cool guy, player, Barney, who's kind of the one that increases the comedy level from a 7 to a 10.There you have it, the typical gang doing one of the greatest shows of the 2000's.I seriously don't get those who give this show bad reviews. It's original, great comedy, great story lines, great characters, great plot, and it definitely has a way to make you wanna keep watching it.Plus the eventual special guest star never fails. It has some of the hottest girls from Hollywood doing appearances, for example: Carrie Underwood, Katie Perry, Jennifer Lopez, Amanda Peet, Britney Spears, Nicole Scherzinger and Mandy Moore to name a few.Seriously, for those of you who think \"Two and a Half Men\" is a great show, I really recommend you to watch \"How I Met Your Mother\", It's way better.\n",
      "1 \t\t It was legend wait for it.... Dary....\n",
      "Legendary!!\n",
      "1 \t\t I have been rewatching this and I forgot how much I liked it. It is very full on with the hopeless romantic stuff and that can get a bit cheesy sometimes, but other times it is really sweet. I find the Lily character very annoying and always have, but sometimes she is okay. I also remember thinking they really messed up the ending which is a shame because it had the potential to have a really good ending. Without giving spoilers I think if they had just gone for a more straight forward maybe a bit predictable ending then that would have ultimately been a lot more satisfying. As far as the good things go I think the humour is nice fun and silly which I like. Ted is great as the main character he can do the dramatic stuff, romantic stuff, but I think he is at his best when he is being dorky and funny. NPH as Barney is great, it is a very funny over the top character and he is a great actor singer dancer etc Jason Segel as Marshall is hilarious he is good as both a straight man and at being goofy and silly. Robin is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen and she is also very funny. There are lots of great running jokes and side plots. It is a really nice feel good show. If you like Friends then you might like this too. Try watching a few episodes of the first season because you will know quite quickly whether you like it. It was a good premise for a romantic comedy. I'm giving it a 9/10 because I think the ending was weak but the rest is all good.\n",
      "1 \t\t Comedy from episode one till the last, you'll love the characters from the very beginning, every season has it's own touch and whoever made these characters is genius, see it you won't regret, yaah and btw its better than frineds.\n",
      "1 \t\t Hi, my name is Rafael and I saw how I meet your mother 2 times, and what I was able to get out of the series was that there are certain things in life that you cannot be stuck with for a lifetime and sometimes you just have to let them go without looking back, and after you have done something it is not worth looking back or massacring yourself with what you have done you just have to accept that everything in life comes and goes even the best things.\n",
      "1 \t\t I admit - you could say how I met your mother is another mindless sitcom HOWEVER that is why it is so enjoyable! You can really relax and just enjoy the tv series, I am a big fan of friends, and yes some of the plot is similar, but the plot of how I met your mother all makes sense! They have carefully made all dates and plot lines fit it together and don't make any slip ups! Would recommend to anyone wanting a funny and relatable tv show to binge watch :)\n",
      "1 \t\t As I'm a big fan of comedy series and liked Friends and TBBT. I liked this one too. All the characters were great but specially Neil & Alyson. Jokes were great too. Background music songs were too good. Although we didn't expect this ending but I liked the ending too. But the things which they did bad were the character of Barney at the end and unknown illness of Ted's wife at the end(I mean no funeral, nothing they showcased) and that's why they received a bad response from viewers.\n",
      "But guys It's a good watch. Some episodes were too great you can watch again and again.\n",
      "1 \t\t I was introduced to this show accidentally but the day I watched this I fell in love with it. This show not only helps to entertain us with its wholesome characters but also teaches a lot of deep things in life in a fun way which otherwise we would have never realised . It helps us to relate ourselves to the show and no matter what you think about the show , we all can seriously agree that in a world like this where people are so inhuman and insensitive this show brings the best out of humanity.I personally would recommend to watch it alone but if your family is invested in it too , then there is nothing better than that. BRO ARMY FOR LIFE!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t As much as I love the show there are moments I think that the creators put in there for fans of Alyson Hannigan and Joss Whedon. Many of you may be thinking what the heck does Joss Whedon have to do with this show? Well, have you caught some of the guest stars? In season one we could have attributed the guest staring of Alexis Denisoff (Wesley of Buffy, then Angel) to being her husband, but then a few episodes later... Amy Acker (Fred of Angel) shows up. In season two, we've had 3. There was Morena Bacharin (Inara of Firefly)and in the same episode, Tom Lenk (Andrew of Buffy and recently Harry Groener (Mayor Wilkins of Buffy). I'm not complaining. I love it. But I wonder if any of the producers on How I Met Your Mother are the same from Buffy or Angel. Keep em' coming.\n",
      "0 \t\t Basically a \"Friends\" rewrite gone wrong and the narration is the worst. Coupled with the awful / cheesy / patriarchal humor and typical 2000's full-white cast? No thanks.\n",
      "1 \t\t Okay, honestly, when I was watching it just waiting a week after week for a new episode, I would rate it a 10/10 until the last two seasons. Then maybe 6/10.last two seasons were kinda disappointing tbh. However, if you are re-watching it again, it is truly a 9/10 love story. Nine tenths of the time it is focused on finding \"the one\", (okay, guys, lets face it, we can relate) and the last tenth is that Ted had a beautiful life with hit wife, had two kids, however the story that he told to his kids, was in the end about Robin. They knew it, we all knew it :).\n",
      "9/10 is only because I am only an amateur critic, and because I still dont understand why Bob Saget had to narrate it.\n",
      "1 \t\t They have been called the plagiarized version of Friends, but they showed the world how important screenplay is in a sitcom.Telling the story from future about how he met his wife to his kids with Ted as the lead of the show annoying his kids(as everyone gets when their parents or relatives starts to say a story). So,what's great about the show which was a medium in which the writers Cater Bays and Craig Thomas could tell their story to people(yes it's a true story as barney would say)",
      ".Wait wait wait!!!I called them screenplay sorcerers and but didn't tell how great they are in their style of storytelling",
      "So let's start about how great they are,shall we?The year is 2017.3 years after the show has ended and yet the impact it made on the people is still felt.Barney Stinson,the character who made people laugh episode after episode and gave them awesome quotes and not only taught Ted but everyone how to live life.His books called the 'playbook' and 'bro code' are some of the awesome books that helped people get women(not that I have tried and succeeded)and made me be a good bro. The year is 2005.The year when The Greatest Sitcom had ended.TV was dying.No good sitcom was running, but it all changed when the show called 'How I Met Your Mother' aired. They took the television by storm with their own style of storytelling and having episodes with emotional twists,great love stories and laughter all 20 minutes of the episode run time.paul96.org/How I Met Your Mother-The Screenplay Sorcererspaul96.org/TED MOSBY-A Prodigious Philosopherpaul96.org/BARNEY STINSON-The Slick Seducer paul96.org/Marshall Eriksen-A Goofy Gratifierpaul96.org/Lily Aldrin-An Elegant Charmer paul96.org/Robin Scherbatsky-A Prudent Professor paul96.org/HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER-The Tantalising Trio paul96.org/HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER-The Best Episodes\n",
      "1 \t\t Amazing perfect good excellent great awesome terrific\n",
      "0 \t\t Utterly crappy sitcom except for occasional BARNEY's Legendary. The only other sitcoms i watched were friends and two and a half men till Charlie was there. Those were good shows because they do what they were meant to, entertain and make us laugh, where as HIMYM try's to teach us some moral crap every episode. most of the episodes are outright boring. Utterly rubbishy confused characterization with very little comedy/ funny moments. I find it hard to understand the 8.6/10 rating. Not worth the time. Everything looks so made up and fake.The twists too look unnatural. I told myself after every episode that its going to get better but it never does. Every episode drags you, for heavens sake they dragged a marriage for almost an entire season.\n",
      "1 \t\t Ted and Robin are always missing and regretting. Lily, wandering between career and marriage, still choose to realize themselves. Even for three months, it's a long-distance view of love. How can we afford to drift across the sea. If the character can be changed at will, Barney is definitely the best choice. No matter what he has experienced and whether he has grown up, the biggest pursuit of life is to be happy and make himself and the people he cares about happy.\n",
      "0 \t\t Too many of the exact subjects covered in Friends are copied. It's the same series but just much much worse. Disappointing\n",
      "1 \t\t I've been watching this show for a while now, catching an episode here and there it wasn't until recently that after watching the whole of season 3 that I really started appreciating it for what it is. The gag rate is great I laugh pretty hard every episode, which I didn't always get with Friends. The cast is great, with Neil Patrick Harris standing out as the blunt, sarcastic, witty one. It centres around five friends,3 men and 2 girls SPOILER ALERT romance ensues between them. If you've seen 'Coupling' its a lot like that with a lot of flashbacks and references to past experiences, also like 'Friends'. If you like razor sharp writing, spot on comedic timing and great story lines. Watch this, its all good!\n",
      "1 \t\t This sitcom is one of the best has some of the best character development in any show which is a shame when you watch the finale as it destroys any of the development we had with The characters like Barney and Robyn got married one episode later there divorced like it maybe a time jump but it overshadowed the the amazing wedding episode.\n",
      "1 \t\t I recently decided to give this show a try. I was never really one for primetime television nor CBS (I used to hate CBS) but after seeing Two And A Half Men and Terms Of Engagement and loving both of them, I decided to give this one a try. I watched a two episode block of the show. The first was descent and I was inclined to turn off the show but I decided to watch the second episode, and thank God I did. It was a great show. It was silly like Scrubs yet had adult type humor like your regular CBS comedies. It did not disappoint. I shouldn't have expected anything less from Jason Segal and Neil Patrick Harris. It's a grand show and I can't wait until the next season premieres, I'm now going to watch this show each week it has a new episode. Great show, highly recommended, especially if you love Scrubs.\n",

      "1 \t\t Good story, great jokes, amazing vibe from the characters. I've seen it in real time and then 6 more times(until mow).Give it a chance, it will amaze you! Thanks for letting me see such a great series :)\n",
      "0 \t\t As always comedy shows aren't that funny and comedy movies aren't that funny also, I thought that this show would be similar to \"friends\" (witch is a peer comedy) but it wasn't it was slightly better but it's not that funny tho , I hated \"Ted\" and i kinda hate \"Robin\" too, the only character i liked is \"Barney\" he knows whats up he's reasonable and wise , lol . I might stop watching this show one day but to say the most the stores r kinda boring and similar, and there is not much comedy in there . BORING NEXT\n",
      "1 \t\t This would've been 10/10 but the ending disappoints me so much\n",
      "1 \t\t The best thing that associated with this tv show is actor Neil Patric Harris.\n",
      "1 \t\t I really think this show has promise, but it needs work. First of all, lose Barney and the show will get twice as good. Second, get better writers, because the humor is rehashed (most of it) Third, Don't save the good moments of the show for the last 5 minutes. Episode 1 and 2 had that problem.Lastly, give this show a chance. I like the concept, and maybe if someone higher up and more respectable than me told the people in charge of this show to fire their current writers, we'd have the only show on CBS that I believe is worth watching (except of course for The Price Is Right)UPDATE: I completely disagree with my outdated review. While in the first few episodes Barney was annoying and felt \"stapled on\", he has developed into a much better character. I disagree with the feeling that he is the \"best character\" however, as I feel the whole ensemble is great. Also, the writing got better quick and the show peaked in Season 2 (Best season so far, but that in no way means that it's gotten bad)If I had anything to add that this show needs is that it needs to balance the \"romantic/serious parts\" with the \"humor\" just a bit more. What made season 2 work best for me is that it had that perfect mix. Season 1 had a little too much \"heart\" and season 3 onwards had a little too much \"humor\", to the point that late season 4 and season 5 it got a little bizarre. What I have seen of the sixth season is that it's getting back on track (hopefully it continues this way)\n",
      "1 \t\t I always think that the best actor combination of this kind of comedy is three men and three women, just like friends. But it's not as good as friends. At first, I hated Barney most, but later I found that he was the most interesting one. Lily and Marshall, it's a little abnormal.\n",
      "1 \t\t i am a completely addicted to series and movies guy, but from everything i had ever seen \"how i met your mother\" is without clue the most awesome stuff ever created. Barney is like a god, the plot is excellent, all the actors are funny and make us all want to live their life! I'm completely thrilled with this quality, some of you might think that i'm overreacting but at the beginning when a friend told me about this my first thought was \"what? how i met what? Such a lame name!\" I watch the first and voilà! :DI recommend How i Met Your Mother to everyone! This series is already LEGENDARY! :)\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show so much and have re-watched it many times. Every episode is hilarious and iconic. All of the characters feel like your friends and have great chemistry.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of best shows ever, Legen-wait for it-Dary11/10\n",
      "1 \t\t At first glance, How I Met Your Mother is a b-grade rip straight from the show, Friends. Josh Radnor plays the Ross character, Cobie Smulders as the Rachel (even the relationship dynamic is a knock-off between the two shows... Will they? Won't they?). Then there is Neil Patrick Harris playing a smarter Joey, but with the same ambition of chasing after as many women as he can. Finally, Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan play the Chandler and Monica characters, the grounded married couple that the other characters revolve around. I wasn't even a fan of Friends, so to stick with this show until it started showing promise was grueling at best (Note to reader: I don't fault anyone who DID like Friends as I can see the appeal, just not my taste).This show teeters constantly on good and average. So I'll start with the good before going into where things get murky. Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigans' characters Marshall and Lily are quite likable, and the two actors have quite a penchant for comedic timing in sitcoms. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, and they provide the highlights that exist in the show.Where things start to go a bit wrong are the other characters. Many people praise Neil Patrick Harris for his turn as the despicable Barney, and while it isn't wholly undeserved, there are some things that people need to keep watch for. Harris delivers most of his lines with the skill of any other veteran actor, the problem lies in the fact that the viewer can actually SEE in his acting that he is ecstatic to be anything but Doogie Howser. Occasionally while watching him, it's almost as if he seeks the attention of the audience much the same as a child on a diving board trying to flag down their parents to watch their jump. He can improve, and I hope he does.Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders play Ted and Robin, the characters whose relationship to one another never gets past anything but frustrating. It's been seen before on every other TV show imaginable, and these two actors don't have the ability to play off of each other well enough to pull it off. Five years after this show goes off the air, these will be the two characters you'll forget the fastest.The show itself was painfully unfunny for the first few episodes, but began to hit its stride by the episode, \"The Slutty Pumpkin\", which was a smart take off of the famous Peanuts scenario where Linus waits diligently for the Great Pumpkin. The dramatic and sentimental moments never hit as hard as they are meant to, and the laughs elicited by Radnor, Smulders, and Harris are short at best, but the laughs derived from the acting of Segel and Hannigan resonate and make the show worth it.\n",
      "1 \t\t It took a little bit for me to get really into this show, but once I did I was hooked until the end. I love how this show is done in a way that is very different from most sitcoms because it makes it very unique. I quote this show all the time in real life.\n",
      "1 \t\t I remember watching this show during my hostel days with my friends. So fun to watch together. Really loved it.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is absolutely great. The characters are hysterical but real. You can identify with everyone of them. I really hope CBS sees the potential in this show and sticks with it. Josh Radnor's portrayal of Ted is simply the every late 20 - something guy. Looking for love and trying to find his place in the world. I think every guy can just really feel being this guy. Being a true and loyal friend. If your not this guy that everyone tries to find some sort of answers from then you know you have a friend like this, either a girl or a guy. Jason Segel and Allyson Hannigan are the perfect portrayal of the perfect couple. Be it when they fight or when they don't. The characters they portray are the type of people you want to become when you find love. You want to be like that when you find that perfect person. You certainly want that person to be your best friend and more. Cobie Smudlers', Robin. is just angelic. She makes a great \"Yang\" to Ted's' \"Ying\". Through all the things that pull them apart, they seem perfect for each other at this time. Maybe for the future as well. There's always that person in someone's life that they walk away from, but seem to always come back to them no matter what anyone says. Now for the cherry on these colorful characters. Neil Patrick Harris as Barney. The over sexed, over dressed, and simply he's just all over the place. His sleaziness and downright conniving character, is brought with warmth as well. It's just great seeing his character Barney act the way he does. It maybe be far-fetched, but he makes it into his own that its just downright believable. This show is a perfect show to have. I haven't seen any comedies since friends touch me in the way it does. You seem to just adore every character on the screen. I always look forward to my Mondays for a good laugh, and it never disappoints. I can't wait for season 2. I hope season 1 comes out on DVD very soon.\n",
      "0 \t\t Friends is better. 🤞. This tv show doesnt stand to friends level yet they mock about it. The.\n",
      "1 \t\t It's the year 2030 and a father of two children (both dressed like neither time has passed nor fashion has changed since the beginning of the century) tells them the story of how he met their mother. That part was quite original and the cast kind of reminded viewers of \"Friends\", and having positively surprised us all, the show scrolled easily to success.Now, it's already been 7 years of narration and still the mother has not been named yet. To make things worse, the jokes are way far fetched and the characters way too exaggerated. One of the plot holes in my opinion is the main character. He's supposed to be romantic and looking for \"the one, true love\" but through his own story we can see that he's switching girls like Madonna switches music styles throughout her >9000 years of experience. I'm not a feminist, but try to imagine an alternative show with a mother telling her kids how she met their father and listing 20-30 different guys. It'd be similar to \"Sex and the city\" but in that case Sarah Jessica Parker didn't tell her stories to her kids because she didn't manage to have any. She's a horse and unfortunately for her, Centaurs exist only in myths.As mentioned before, it's the year 2030 and we can see that Mosby's oldest kid is about 15-17 years old. So she was born in 2013-2015 and thus we are getting closer to the big revelation. My guess is a huge twist. I place my bet on Robin. Don't ask me why he's been calling her \"aunt\" Robin to the kids though. Perhaps it was a lie he used so that he could tell the whole story about getting to marry her without giving away that it was her all along.See the original post of this review here: http://pointlesscritics.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-i-never-met-your- mother.html\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is the best sitcom for me and it's not even close! You just get carried away by the great story, very good acting, funny humor and just the overall vibe of the series. It also teaches you much about life! The end wasn't as bad as anyone makes it in my eyes!\n",
      "1 \t\t I haven't watched this series since 2014?? I remembered being super annoyed about the ending, and it left a bad taste afterwards.I decided to rewatch it after seeing some easter egg/references videos and I was surprised how clever this series was at times (the purple vs. Yellow theory is probably my favourite).After rewatching, I can finally say that it wasn't the ending that ruined the franchise, instead it was the last 2 seasons. Why put the audience through this rollercoaster of convincing us that Robin and Barney should be together and Ted backtracking on his feelings, when it feels like it'll be redacted in the next few episodes. I now know that Ted and Robin can work if Robin has finally gotten the career experience that she has always wanted, and when Ted has 2 kids, but the execution was so poor.They should've introduced the mother in the beginning of Season 8, Barney and Robin realising that they're not compatible so they don't get married, and end that season with Ted meeting the mother. The last season should be about when the kids were born. We can see the mother's doppleganger, how she feels about Ted and Robin's past relationship, see how the kids interact with their Aunt Robin, etc. This way we can see more of Tracey until she passes away, Robin's true feelings for Ted, and the kids building their blessing for their father to date Robin.For a character that has aged poorly in this day and age, I still find his character to be incredibly amusing. It's also funny how he coincidentally goes PC mode in 2020, even though that episode was made in 2013.For a sitcom, I really like how they use the audience soundtrack. It fits in perfect moments, but it's clearly edited so that it doesn't interfere important moments, and so we don't hear obnoxious over the top laughter after a small joke.In terms of relationships, I am annoyed that Nora and Barney never committed, or at the very least see Nora's flaws (damn she was perfect).\n",
      "1 \t\t If the show had been about Ted finding the mother of his children like the title says then this could have been a good series but people like Burnie and Robin ruin it , It becomes a toilet jokes show that was not it's original intention , the are good part yes Lily and Marshall are funny , the are good episodes but for most part it's just not that good.\n",
      "0 \t\t First of all, I would like to say that this is a very good sitcom or at least it started that way. It definitely makes you laugh, and the idea of telling your children about your marriage is refreshing.THE START : A bunch of friends in Manhattan (A cliché, but still) sitting at bar, having fun, hitting on girls, talking about memories and stuff. It keeps you hooked, the first few seasons definitely do.THE PROBLEM : Well, It is evident that the makers or the writers don't have anything better to do. Maybe you can't blame the writers, because old ones have left. Whoever it is, all they want to do is drag this for 10 seasons or more. (SPOILER) Like the Slap deal extension. BOTTOM LINE : There is no story line.CONSEQUENCES : You get bored with the same bunch of people, if you watch them for 7 seasons.Lets add more detail here.Marshal and Lily - Most probably the most boring characters, at least comparably. Stories involving them are definitely boring. Too much whining gets irritating after a while. Gladly, there is less stories of Marshall right now. Lily is the genius who knows all, wins all, hence is quite predictable. They hardly do anything but keep Barney busy.Ted Mosby - He is made to look like a total jerk. He is the main character but he is becoming dumber and dumber by each episode.Robin - Well, she started off brilliantly. Got famous through this role ( Apparently, she is in the Avengers !! ) But, right from the moment she slept with you know who's friend, she has become one thing - Sl*t ! All she is doing next is sleeping with you know who again, and the friend again, barring few guys in between including the naked man.All this is just due to the fact that just 5 people for 7 seasons is stupid. I.e., without a story line!You know whoever that joins the group is going to be kicked out.And the only reason the show is still running is BARNEY STINSON. Otherwise, Zzzzz.\n",
      "1 \t\t I watched it first when i was a child, and i thought it was a funny show. Now that im rewatching it in my mid 20's I can see how the sow themes so many problems u got in this time. Either in finding love or your job live and many more. And with showing that in a humorous way, on one hand it takes you the fear and on the other hand it shows you that you are \"normel\", with all the proböems your dealing with.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the friends of my generation. I haven't watched friends, yes i know it's blasphemy. I suspect it is in the same style and disposition. But, this is the one i grew up watching and it is good.Plus - Neil Patrick Harris <3\n",
      "1 \t\t Everyone needs a friendship like Ted and Marshall. But everyone wants to be like Barney. Anyway, it's a 10-point series if not the last season.\n",
      "0 \t\t Promotes promiscuity, normalize obsession with sex and promotes taboos related with normal people, and its too dangerously progressive.Don't waste time on this crap.Nothing compared to modern family, MF is best show ever. You will surely want to kill yourself after watching this show and suggesting people to watch it.\n",
      "1 \t\t Oh my god,I don't know how to start. well it is a very unique and most amazing show that is the best show in the whole universe. You should definitely watch the show if you haven't. It is about this amazing bro called Ted Mosby, who is trying to find 'the one' after dating many many girls. He is still best friends with his friends from college, and meets this girl called Robin, who he falls in love with and they do go out but they go on and off, and he also has another friend who is a handsome suit loving player, who scores a girl every day. It is basically the dramas, laughs and happenings of the gang, and it it legen-wait for it-dary. Unfortunately it has finished forever so that a bummer. Anyway it is the most amazing thing in the world.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is so easy to watch, it's funny, the characters are great. The overall story has a lot of potential, but it was just wrapped up so badly. Robin and ted were so forced at the end. Barney had a large amount of character development just to go back to how he was in season 1 in a depressing ending to what was a great sitcom. However apart from Season 9 it was probably one of my favourite comedy shows out there.\n",
      "0 \t\t Barney is awesome and I REALLY HATE LILLY SHES RUIN EVERYTHING AND WHENEVER HER SCENE COME I JUST HATE HER You WATCH YOU FIGURE IT OUT WHAT I MEAN.....\n",
      "0 \t\t It was \"legendary\" in first 7 seasons but then the jokes started to feel familiar and the same. Last season was spent with unnecessary fantasy stories. Also the final... left a feeling of emptiness, it was predictable and it was absurd.\n",
      "1 \t\t No spoilers here (was going to add some but not)great show! All the episodes kept me laughing and were all uniquely written.The end, finale and the 5 or so episodes leading to it sucked so much a$$ that I would recommend just watching up to that point and skipping the finale.You WILL be disapointed, and it will RUIN what was a good show all the way through.Also the transition to the \"end results\" were VERY poorly written and must have been hastily written to close out all (and finalize) the show.\n",
      "0 \t\t Binged watch the series, sometimes felt like Friends wannabe. The best character was Barney and the poorest was Ted. No development at all and don't know why but the writers kept Ted the same all over. First few seasons were good but it went downhill from there. I watch friend or the big bang theory (1/2 episodes) when there was nothing to do at home but won't watch HIMYM again.Oh, the ending was boring.\n",
      "0 \t\t Why? Why? Why did I watch this show? There's nothing unique in it. Overacting is main thing that is the worst about this show.Well, there are certain bunch of people who compare this show with FRIENDS. I mean yes it has humor but nothing compared to FRIENDS. Although you may find that few scenes, sequences, characteristics and even dialogues are same as FRIENDS.Now let's talk about the characters. All of them has done great job on overacting, except Barney Stinson (payed by Neal Patrick Harris). I mean yes, he's doing overacting here but his characters rules that out. If you really want to watch this show, watch it for Barney Stinson only. Rest of characters are the worst.I'll go re-watch FRIENDS over this nonsense.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've always had that \" why\" in my head throughout the whole story , I've always thought It deserved more than what they were giving me , It couldn't be as disposable as they were making It be . That had to end up into something greater , something not so easily extinguished .That ending just made me realize that I was not seeing things; What always seemed to be more than what appeared was indeed as or more significant than what I thought. It was a relief to see that there are things that last forever .In a corner we had perfect love , ridiculously perfect love, that just happened; full of coincidences; the love that; when felt; ain't surpassed by anything.And on the other corner we had a love that, even if is not as romanticized, is full of context. A stubborn and unpredictable love that grows and creates roots. That even when it seems to have disappeared , is always there. It is a love that does not produce a perfect ending, but it sure as hell creates one worth living for.I was happy to see that what makes sense, sooner or later, ends up happening.\n",
      "1 \t\t I was a huge fan of friends so i thought it would be cheating if i watch how i met your mother , hahabut beside of joking this sitcom got so many life changing lessons for you guys.S6E14 changed mine ! Lets see which episode will change yours or at least teach you some lessons to make better decisions in your life.\n",
      "0 \t\t Most boring TV show ever seen. If it wasn't for Barney and Marshall, I would rather seen the news which would be funnier. Prolonged, non-sense TV show. Kids, bla bla bla. Kids, bla bla bla. Kids, bla bla bla. F*****g annoying. Ted always whining about finding his future wife. He forced himself to believe that every woman he dated was the one. Childish!!! Lilly is the most curious woman I have ever seen in my life. Always wants to know what's going on with other people life. Basically she has nothing better to do with her life. Boring!!! Robin...oh Robin. If she wasn't pretty and sexy, the show would be even boring. At least I used to last longer watching the show. Thanks nature for bringing such a beauty in this world. I only give credit to awesome Barney and Marshall. Barney reminded me a lot in Charlie of \"Two and a Half Men\". He makes me laugh although his rules are sometimes non-sense. Marshall in my opinion is the best. He's very funny and cute. He's also a good actor in other movies. Keep it up!!!Anyways, I'm sorry for such review, but if the show was shorter, I think it would have been much much much better. I gave 2/10 for Barney and Marshall only.Regards from Valletta, Malta\n",
      "1 \t\t After watching the movie, you will really appreciate the friendship of this group of friends. Around the familiar table at Maclaren's pub, all incidents or stories that happen in those characters's life, it's just so wonderful, touchful and peaceful. Every character can solve their problem together, comfort together and that was totally heartwarming. The group is a place to go whenever you feel tired, broken or hurt. Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin or Barney can all be relied upon.I really like this quote from Barney:\"Whatever you do in life, it's not legendary until your friends are there to see it\"\n",
      "Throughout this sitcom i've learnt a lot of thing about friendship, love and how to live better. The show just helped me a lot in my tough time and gave so much fun into my boring life\n",
      "Always loves this show and IN MY OPINION\n",
      "HIMYM >>>FRIENDS.AND I LOVE BOTH OF SHOWS.\n",
      "0 \t\t It shouldn't have been like this.You've got a cast of talented young actors. The premise might run out of steam at some point - but we haven't reached it in a few episodes.But in a comedy, especially one that lays claim to being about a relationship, you expect writing with some depth and characterization. Instead, we get shallowness and caricature. An actor like Neil Patrick Harris ends up mugging for the camera for lack of anything better to do. Alyson Hannigan had deeper characters to work with in American Pie.Bays and Thomas would be better employed on someone's writing staff, contributing jokes and bits. They can unquestionably be funny - but so far, they have failed to deliver characters with more than one dimension in any of their series.Cancel this train wreck. Let the actors get on to something better.\n",
      "1 \t\t Show is really great, very funny (maybe not so much if you are a PC person) characters are very likeable (well not Ted) and Barney is judt the best.. but THAT ending..\n",
      "It's pretty obvious that they plan the endind early in the show run and kept it many seasons later ignoring completely the development of the characters. I wacthed it years ago and I'm still mad about it.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show has a great plot, it's a creative idea that I think is new and fresh. I haven't seen it before. It's the journey of a man meeting the love of his life, with the help of his friends. He's telling his kids how he met her. The acting is fairly believable, especially that of Ted. His character is sweet and compassionate, a man determined and hopeful of finding his soul-mate. The other characters add the comedy, and the drama. Great plot, great characters and actors.The show can be inappropriate at times, but let's be honest, what GOOD shows and movies don't have a few inappropriate moments? The only thing I don't like, is that in the show's most recent season, season 8, the inappropriate moments have piled up. In my opinion, after the first two episodes from season 8, it went downhill. It just lost its heartfelt meaning and became all about dirty jokes. But I didn't lose hope, and I kept watching. Sure enough, there were some heartfelt episodes, especially at the end. Also, Barney has gradually become more mature, and less dirty, which I liked.I know that a lot of the fans like the dirty jokes and inappropriate moments, but I think they forget that young teenagers watch this too. Some of them watch it for the cute romance story, I know that's what I watch it for. I'm hoping season 9 won't disappoint, but I'm not very confident about it.One thing I do know is that when we finally see Ted meet his wife, it will be an amazing moment. It may not meet everyone's expectations, but it will still be memorable.If you start to lose hope in the series, I urge you to not give up on it!\n",
      "1 \t\t What a show its hilarious. Everything about the show is just awesome. You cant tell whats gonna happen next. Everyone has a perfect role.Barney is my favorite, i cant even imagine the show without Barney every single thing about Barney is just great, his acting is terrific too. I mean all that statistical data he make up, the way he refuse to tell about his job and the way he says LEGENDARY.Tedd, Robin, Marshal & Lily are great also. I like everyone in the show, I even like Ranjit the cab driver. Everyone in the show has done a great job but Barney stands out.The show is awesome and is a must see.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just bought the first season and I'm in between second season episodes. But basically this is the greatest show ever. It has heart, it has wit, it has childish humor, it has a great writing team that makes the insignificant moments in life become fate. That and each character is amazingly awesome/legendary. Each individual character can relate to every different kind of person and with a variety of storyline for each individual character, its easy to become emotionally attached to each of their stories, triumphs, downfalls, jokes, etc. Simply, a brilliant ensemble. The writing has a knack for creating funny, memorable lines as well as captivating moments that can bring a wide variety of emotions in only thirty minutes of television. The plot is genius and keeps you motivated to continue watching, not just for the usual jokes or to just kill time, but to see how one man's life builds up to the title. Watching the romances and relationships in this show is quite delightful.\n",
      "0 \t\t Terrible and really dumb ending, Ted can't wait for yet another \"love of his life\" to die to be with Robin..... again. Really?! What a moronic idea, like they haven't tried it a hundred times before. And that's the most repulsive character in the show, who pretends to be a nice guy, while lying through his teeth and always omitting the truth to his convenience in order to look nice and to get validation from others. Aghh!\n",
      "1 \t\t The show itself was fantastic, definitely a 10/10 overall. Except the last two episodesJust completely ruined everything and removed 2 seasons worth of character development from Barney, close to 4 from Ted, and just fully discredited Ted's search for the one by killing her off then putting him with Robin. Sure back in the earlier seasons people were rooting for that but by season 9 that wasn't the case anymore. Makes it seem like the mother was just a consolation for Ted not being able to get Robin when she was with BarneyBy far the most disappointing end to a series I've ever seen. I've heard about the alternate ending and just by hearing about it its obvious that one would've been much better that the one they went with.\n",
      "1 \t\t A friend of mine told me: \"You should see this serial it's AWESOME, it's like 'Friends'!\". He also added: \"I watched the whole first season for 2 days\". \"Ah... like FRIENDS you say\"-I thought- \"Scarcely\". And yes it wasn't like 'friends', because 'friends' is the greatest serial i've ever seen, but 'How I Met Your Mother' is in chase of 'Friends' and maybe one day it will leave behind the old 'friends'. Now synopsis of 'How I Met Your Mother' It is about a dude who is telling his children, how he met their mother. His name is Ted and he has four friends. Contrary to 'friends' they're two girls and 3 boys (with Ted). There are courting couple among them. The other guy Barney is absolute playboy, he always wears a suit and has a lot of dates, nobody knows what he works. In my opinion Barney is the funniest character in the serial. The last girl is Robin, she is a reporter. Ted loves her and she loves him but they are not together for one reason or another. 'How I Met Your Mother' is really funny and relaxing serial and I'm sure you will like it!\n",
      "1 \t\t This TV show excels more than any other sitcom nowadays! It's a high quality comedy, more than very well known shows (such as Glee or The Big Bang Theory, also among my favorites) with many very ingenious situations that go through every episodes.The Story begins in 2030, when Ted Mosby (or a voice-off version of him, that narrates during the hole episode, played by Bob Saget) starts telling his kids the story of how he met their mother. Now don't you worry, i'm not actually spoiling any details, except that this takes us back to 2005 where Ted's story begins. Since then we meet the young Ted (played by a very endearing and charming Josh Radnor) a hopeless romantic architect, who suddenly decides he wants to find the perfect woman to settle down with. That's when we meet Marshall Eriksen (played by the always hilarious Jason Seigel) a very nice, small-town guy, who's finishing his law career in college; and his long time girlfriend, Lily Aldrin (played by the cute ginger Alyson Hannigan, one of America's sweetheart) a smiley kinder garden teacher. This couple is just perfect! Later comes along Robin Scherbatsky (played by the very sarcastic-humorized Cobie Smulders) the cynical Canadian news reporter, who crushes the group and fits right in. Oh! and let's never forget about the...what's the word to describe this man? Oh yes..AWESOME! Barney Stinson (played by the extremely talented Neil Patrick Harris in what's gonna be remembered as one of his biggest lifetime roles, which already gave him several nominations to the Emmy) as the ladies man of the group, who has already reached everyone who watches this show's heart! With this amazing group, and a never ending story of how this Ted guy met his kids mother (a story that keeps as all fans to the edge of our sits every Monday night, by the way) we witness the most incredible, original, crazy and hilarious adventures they go through, along with laughter, tears and emotions that the world has only felt for only one other show before: the very F.R.I.E.N.D.S. (1994-2004), nothing less than the most beloved (and already, a cult) TV sitcom ever in history.Careful! it's gonna be legen...wait for it...\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this sitcom so much but the office is faking butter than and i love you\n",
      "0 \t\t How I met the TV set with the floor. That is exactly what I would like to do when that Doogie Howser character shows up on my TV screen. He has always sucked as an actor. And the character in this show isn't even close to being funny. If you ask your father how he met your mother it wouldn't take this long to explain. Hopefully we find out how he did meet her, so they can take this off the air. Even 2 1\\2 Men can't save this. We'll that's what I'm hoping. These guidelines are stupid also. This should be where you can give some decent reviews but now I have to drown on like this so it will be accepted. So now I have to put another line in. And another line, and another line etc.....\n",
      "0 \t\t Himym has a whole topsy turvy points and a base like friends. But the show is great it's just promoting everything at the same time which are bad and good things. Like Ted Mosby is a guy who is a book reader, an architect a person who admires everything but having the same opposite friend Barney who is a total playboy doesn't respects women, having a playbook, etc......it seems like his gang is okay with it and has accepted it but it's not cool. On the other hand Robin is just toxic at so many points and yeah directors wanted to show that a woman can pursue her dreams leaving everything behind but using Ted as a rebound wasn't good, like why always going back to exes.But apart from everything it's worth watching How i met your mother. The perfect sitcom to binge watch and spend your 20 mins.I'm so glad that i watched this series because it's Legen wait for it Daryyyyy!!!.\n",
      "1 \t\t Funny, witty and utterly charming, this show has it all. With equally interesting and at the same time very different characters, it manages to remain entertaining throughout all the seasons. It made me laugh, it made me cry and I have never been more invested in a character's story-line. Neil Patrick Harris is no doubt the most outstanding comedian in the group, but I can't help but love the rest of the gang as well.What I love most about this show is how in almost every episode, it touches upon issues that every one of us at some point has related to. Every character is flawed but in the end you cannot - in my opinion - dislike any of them, because of how relatable they are. It may have some clichés and a not so well received ending, but there is no doubt that HIMYM will always be funny and relevant.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show, I didn't think much of it the first couple times I watched it but now that i'm more familiar with the show's humor and the characters, I can now call myself a fan.The performances from the entire cast, especially NPH, are all hilarious and lovable. I can't decide which character I like the most because there all so likable and funny. The writing for each and every one of them is absolutely brilliant and pretty relatable at times. The humor is sort of a mix of so funny because it's true and funny based on the likability of all the characters. It's a little hard to explain.Bottom line, this is a great show, I just wish it didn't go down hill after season four. That's not to say that seasons 5, 6, and 7 suck it's just that the episodes aren't as funny as they used to be and are more hit or miss and kind of inconsistent. But no matter, I can always just revisit my favorite episodes from seasons 2 through 4 and go to a happy place where nothing else matters and I can just enjoy myself for a good 20 minutes.\n",
      "1 \t\t I really enjoy the futuristic, yet not-so-futuristic spin it takes. It begins in 2030, but you don't see the futuristic technologies and architecture that you may expect. Throughout the Series, it keeps a very down-to-Earth mood, just like any Sit-Com should. In the Series, there are many segments of Barney's (Neil Patrick Harris) life, which are awesome. I personally think that Barney is the best character because of his constantly casual attitude. I love the fact that the character Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) is a kind of loose father character that isn't afraid to tell his kids about the time Barney banged seven chicks in a row, but cuts out all the swears. On the other hand, I don't understand why the V.O. Father at 2030 is not Josh Radnor, and is in fact Bob Saget. That is why my vote is a nine, not a ten.\n",
      "1 \t\t For me no show is better than this show... Its like star trek for ted I watch it when I'm hungry, sad, happy, alone anytime..\n",
      "1 \t\t To contradict the title, it's not just a sitcom. It's life. HIMYM stands out from any other series because it has a very unique formula. The storytelling is great, it's funny, the jokes are not shoved and forced (despite some of the catchphrases being not really good), and each episode can help in a way to get to the full story and if it doesn't, it would be a great filler episode. The cast is amazing, and each character has a depth especially Barney who everyone seems to display as a superficial womanizing man. It doesn't follow the generic sitcom formula. It doesn't depend on a character being idiot or way too over imaginary just for fun (uhm, FRIENDS) and, of course, it's not just about the funny moments. When the events turn sad, WE CAN RELATE. Life isn't always about happiness and fun. This series really picked FRIENDS' problems and fixed it to make a better show. It also teaches us many, many life lessons. And it's most important lesson: Love lasts forever. Life changes, Friends come and go but love always stays. The ending is also clever as it stayed true to the plot and was really unexpected.\n",
      "My only bad comment about it is that the 9th season was really forced and unnecessary. It kinda ruined the empire of this great TV show. Despite that, it's still one of the greatest things in my life.\n",
      "1 \t\t I honestly love that tv show so much and i'm really sad that it had to end. The only reason i'm not giving it 10/10, is just season 5 as far as I remember was kinda disappointing. But in general it's a remarkable tv show that will be around for a long long time. For whoever didn't watch it yet, I will hundred percent recommend it!\n",
      "1 \t\t Better than Friends\n",
      "Better than everything\n",
      "Love you\n",
      "0 \t\t Yeah it's a top 10 show in my books but the ending is just not very good at all and the only thing you can do is try to forget it exists, I would recommend not watching the ending at all instead watching one of the countless fan made endings\n",
      "0 \t\t I've watched HIMYM 4 times and everytime I get to season 9 is like a waste of time watching it, I love Barney and Robin but the fact that they make a whole season around their wedding just to divorce at the end of series, then Tracy dies and Robin ends up with Ted, that's the worst ending they could have given them, they should have called the TV show \"How I Met Robin\" then. Besides that last season and that horrible series finale everything in this TV show is perfect, amazing characters and episodes that never fail to make you laugh, one of my favorites of all time without doubt.\n",
      "1 \t\t So, this is a pretty okay show. Its something to pass the time, but no real special moments in this one. The cast are mostly very good actors - Josh Radnor and NPH. NPH is spectacular especially in the few episodes where he interacts with his biological father. Even the prior episodes leading to the search for his dad are quite something to watch. When it comes to humor, NPH and Radnor provide it all. They're terrific. NPH is obviously the standout performer.A key difference I've found between Friends and HIMYM is while the former touched on LGBT personnel, it was often crudely meant and in a demeaning manner. HIMYM does a much better job of it. It's definitely the more progressive show keeping with the times. Although there is some fat-shaming which hopefully will be eradicated from mainstream TV soon. So with all these pluses, why do I rate it average? Lily and Marshal -> No, they aren't a cute couple. Lily is particularly annoying and I cannot imagine anyone being friends with a controlling and overbearing character, always ready to thrust herself in others' businesses. Marshall is a good character by himself but his relationship dynamic with Lily is too mushy, clingy and not healthy. It's a clingy-needy relationship and not a healthy endorsement for couples. Excessively dramatic acting doesn't help either. I don't mean the comical scenes, I mean the serious ones where she tries to help barney and Robin back together, among other things. During the latter seasons the writers project this couple as what holds the group together, but it is still a very irritating dynamic for people who have actually been in relationships and strong friendships. Overall, a great show to watch to pass the time, but nothing more than that.\n",
      "1 \t\t The show grows on you. The characters are lovely and the chemistry among them makes you love the show.\n",
      "However the ending makes no sense to me. Also last 2 seasons are average as there are unnecessary flashbacks\n",
      "1 \t\t Barney Stinson is the man! This is one of those shows that you can't forget and stop watching. Every episode makes me want more. Their friendship is presented so real that I wish I have it just like they do. I'm not sure who is my favorite character. There is Barney who is so funny, easygoing guy, getting different girl every night, but you can never judge him, cause he is amazing! Ted is boring for moments, but one thing he truly want is to find the ONE. There is nothing bad in that, right? Lilly and Marshall are a different story. They have found each other a lot time ago and they are very happy together. It makes me want to have what they have. Robyn is the character I'm attached to least. I could watch this show even if she decides to go back to Canada lol. Anyway, I love it, 10/10. I HOPE TED NEVER TELLS HIS KIDS HOW HE MET THEIR MOTHER!\n",
      "1 \t\t Loved every single episode and characters. This show is just super fun and you are always left wanting more.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show was all the rage while I was in high school. The later seasons were airing and people knew it was going downhill, as most comedies do after 4 or 5 seasons, but the ending floored so many with how bad it was. Someone on reddit, if I remember correctly, predicted most of the facets and plot points of the final season several years earlier, and the internet was mad that the show ended how it did.\n",
      "1 \t\t I think this show can be compared directly to \"Friends\" as they have so many common elements. Ross with Ted, Rachel with Robin, Monica with Lily, Chandler with Marshall, and Joey with Barney. I think the weakest link of this show are the two girls, Robin and Lily. Robin is beautiful and attractive, but doesn't have the same charisma that Rachel has. I think in comparing Monica and Lily, Monica's character is fully developed as an intimidating person, whereas Lily is just a sweet sweet person.I think Ted and Ross act out their roles pretty much in the same manner, so there's not a significant difference there; although i would definitely hand the edge to Ross for his 'dinosaur' job, and his whole 'i was on a break thing'. Marshall is funny in his own way, but Chandler is hilarious in Friends. But i guess they cant't be compared directly because they play out their roles differently; with Chandler providing the sarcastic gay jokes, and Marshall being a nice plain guy (like Ted).Barney is the only guy I would think is better than Joey. Some of his antics and other sayings are hilarious, and seems to be pulling the rest of the cast along with his animated personality; all the other characters seem to be a bit off to me in terms of providing the audience with a different perspective. Each friends character gives the audience something different, whereas in HIMYM , Barney is the only one doing that.In both the shows, sometimes you cant believe these guys are about to be thirty; anyways that besides the point. However, HIMYM talks solely about the character's relationships and sex lives, whereas in Friends you had all that; BUT you had job problems, problems with parents, and lots of other aspects. This show is decent, but gets a but monotonous after a while with the same storyline, but still keeps you glued to it. However, Friends seemed to be a more well-rounded show to me.I think Ashley Williams showed a lot of promise, and should be given another chance. I just hope she is the one for Ted, although it seems unlikely. As for the elder Ted's voice, the first time i heard the background voice was in the 'Wonder Years', so i guess thats not original either; although the elder dad telling his kids about how he met their mother probably is. An OK show, if the other characters were more developed. But Robin and Lily are so beautiful and cute, they keep you glued to the show.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show,great characters,great storyline but the last season was extended mainly for audience to know the Mother's character more closely. And Cristin Milioti did a great job persuing that role. But the last two episode got on my nerve. They fast forwarded through so many events and undid a few character arc in between that. Robin and Barney were so great together. But only for a surprise element which was shot 7-8 before the finale they made unnecessary changes.\n",
      "So, definitely watch the show but don't think about the ending so much.\n",
      "1 \t\t I didn't start watching this show until about the middle or the end of season five and continued to watch it on television until season eight. I eventually watched the first four seasons and last season much later. Now, let me start by saying that this sitcom is not for everyone. It is very fast-paced and laden with quirky and off-beat humor about certain topics that you would have to know about in order to understand.This series follows the romantic exploits of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor), who is known to over-the-top and somewhat questionable romantic gestures and is known to be a bit pretentious. Throughout his journey to find his one true love, he meets Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), and after a date, Ted makes the big mistake of telling her that he loves her, which pretty much scares her off. On the way, he receives relationship advice and support from his friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris).Throughout nine seasons and 208 episodes, we see Ted and his many romantic partners and the predicaments that he finds himself in, as well as other character's obstacles, such as Marshall losing his job and Barney finally trying to resolve his issues with his father.All characters are relatable in this show, but I think that my favorite character would have to be Barney, though I am more similar to Ted. I like Barney because he starts off as this suave and charismatic ladies man only to change his personality after season four and try to actually start dating instead. Barney can be a bit of a douche-bag when it comes to his friends, but he is very loyal and very resourceful (I'm talking about the Bro Code, here). However, I really do like all of the characters because each of them provide something that we can all find in each of us, whether it be dealing with the loss of a parent or dealing with a parent that doesn't really seem have your best interests at heart.This show can really appeal to anyone, even if you don't really understand the humor, because it is actually much more than a sitcom. It can showcase different instances in a person's life and determine all human emotions. I am not much of a crier when it comes to watching television and movies, but I will admit that I did cry a few times when watching this show, and I have watched it all the way through at least twice.The end of the series has really brought on much debate and controversy. And though I won't divulge fully what happened, I will say this: I am glad that it ended like it did, because it showcases how life can be sometimes. Life isn't perfect, and this sitcom demonstrates that expertly. Sometimes you can find the love of your life quickly (like Marshall and Lily did), or you might just have to wait a long time like Ted did, or you might not actually find your true love at all. Either way, I find that this show really enlightens its viewers on that perfectly.This show can be very inspirational to those who watch it. I have actually formed a bit of a philosophy based on How I Met Your Mother, and I still pretty much live it to this day. As my summary says, it is my top five favorite sitcoms of all time, and I will probably continue to watch it and re-watch until I just simply cannot anymore.Like most television shows that I watch, I tend to favor the earlier seasons rather than the later seasons. This one is no exception. I believe from season one to about the end of season four, maybe season five, that this show put out consistently high quality television. I'm not saying that later seasons are not good; it's just that I tend to think more prevalently about the earlier seasons, especially season two.Another aspect about this show that I like is the fact that it had staying power, meaning it didn't last just two or three seasons. Most shows nowadays can barely pass the first season mark. And I do believe this was one of the last really, really good shows that had this kind of lasting impression on viewers, not that I mean to disrespect other sitcoms such as the Big Bang Theory and Modern Family, both of which have been long-lasting as well and are really enjoyable as well.Overall, How I Met Your Mother is definitely worth a watch all the way though. It is really funny if you understand the certain references, dramatic when the situation calls for it, and heartfelt when the perfect moment hits. You can watch this if you need to feel better and you can watch it if you just need a good cry. Don't go your whole life without watching it, because it is really that good. I give it a nine out of ten.\n",
      "1 \t\t I have never reviewed anything on here before but i couldn't resist. How I Met Your Mother is hands down my favorite show on TV these days. While I'll admit it's not deep, it is a dead on depiction for how my friends and I interact and live our lives. It's a perfect depiction of the mid- twenties -- you're not in college anymore, you're just starting out in your career/love life/ whatever, and you have a solid group of friends with whom to pass the days.And, I wouldn't compare it to Friends. I don't think I've ever knowingly quoted an episode, recapped one with my friends days later or just laughed out loud when thinking about an episode of Friends. With this show, I do. And, if you want the most comprehensive list of Barney-isms and quotes from the show, Wikipedia has a great list. My best friend and I like to pick out our favorites for a mid-day email laugh.\n",
      "1 \t\t One of the best shows. I absolutely love it,i loved every season.\n",
      "1 \t\t Amazing, the last episode sucks upon first, 2nd and 3rd watch but the pain is fading, still worth the watch. Great character. Love them!\n",
      "1 \t\t and did a lot of things I really shouldn't be telling my kids. That's what this series should be called. Really, Ted should have met the Mother by the end of the first season, after that the story just became redundant. All that being said, I really loved the episode, How your mother met me.It was written with a cleverness that has been absent since the second season. I would like to see this season end on a high note with a very interesting storyline of Ted and the Mother meeting and falling in love.If you made a DVD of all the episodes connected to the How your mother met me episode and ended it with the rest of this season, then you'd have a good story. Otherwise, a better title would be, Have You Met Ted.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show was a phenomenon when it aired. 200 episodes, re-runs after re-runs.I just rewatched some early episodes and can't believe how bad this show is. All the iconic popcultural moments this show brought forth are just a handful of episodes. The rest is just boring as hell. The characters are lame and exactly the kind of people you want to avoid in real life, the writing is predictable and my god is it kitsch. With that said, I don't deny it has some binge-watching potential if you are terribly bored and need some background noise doing housework or whatever other brainless activity.Definitely a show to leave in the past.\n",
      "1 \t\t If you are alone and you can't see the good things such as friendship, love in you life, just start How I Met Your Mother. Characters really make me happy and the story is incredible. Even the last 2 seasons are a bit of disappointment, I promise you will not regret watching this show. It sometimes make you laugh so hard, sometimes it makes you cry and drives you to get emotional and sometimes when an episode ends you feel in the need of thinking about the ending of the episode for hours. It's is one of the best shows I've ever watched. And it's awesome that episodes are only 20 mins. So you'll be able to decide how long you'll watch. I was watching 4-5 episodes a day tho!\n",
      "1 \t\t It has Been pretty criticized but I think it was wonderful, to cry. The only thing that's cuestionable is that Barney doesn't end with nobody, but the scene with his daughter Is amazing. I don't get those who said Ted should end with Tracy, it appeared in 15 episodes tops. I didn't had time to like the character, I think Ted and robin was the right choice and the turn that nobody expect👏\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't normally write review but I can't skip this one. It became my forever favorite sitcom. Nothing can beat it till now. And I'm fighting the urge to go back and rewatch it everyday. Every ep truly made my day. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show! I started watching this show less than a week ago, and I already am on the 4th season! This show is great! I really can't say that I dislike any characters in the show. But I can say that Barney, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is my favourite character! The show has a normal idea for a plot, but what is added is amazing. So many humorous moments, especially from Barney who is always getting girls back to his place for a great night, but by the next day, he never wants to see them again. Other characters such as Ted, who the show is about is also really funny - especially his on-and off again relationship with the character Robin. Basically, I recommend this show to anyone who just wants to watch a silly show and laugh all day long. 10 out 10 in my opinion.\n",
      "0 \t\t I really liked the first 5 seasons but I just can't seem to finish season 7, it's so horrible and boring. They should have already introduced the mother by this point. I feel like there are so many pointless episodes that are just \"fillers\" and they aren't even funny...\n",
      "Sadly this ended up not being a show for me.\n",
      "1 \t\t The characters are so relatable, the homour is very funny and unique. And unlike many other sitcoms it has an ongoing plot, which can be sometimes a bit kitsch but in a good way. The concept behind it is brilliant, and though the ending is not great I don't know if it's that's bad either. So yeah, hands down the best sitcom ever and of the best shows on general.\n",
      "1 \t\t i am really disappointed to hear so many people compare this show to friends. whats up with that??? while friends wasn't the worst show ever made... it is nothing compared to this show. this show is brilliant. the humor is far more intelligent. \"Friends\" just makes fun of unrealistically stupid people. \"How I met your mother\" has characters that are not only believable but that also have very relatable every day problems. and while the problems are common ones, the writers skillfully show the humor of life. i believe this show is more comparable to the genius of Seinfeld, because although the characters of the two shows are not at all alike, this show highlights interpersonal conflicts in a way that almost no other show has done.and the casting! omg how brilliant to get Neil patrick harris and bob sagot! two icons of the 20 something generation! Niel patrick harris has some serious talent for acting like an ass! please watch this show because if they replace it with another reality show about celebrity tricks, i think i might hurl my television out the window!\n",
      "1 \t\t I started HIMYM with a lot of prejudice. But I'm just too late to watch HIMYM. I constantly moving forward to start day by day. First few episodes are a little boring but than it's start. You see things that you can make for your real life. Actual sections from your life. Characters are quiet in place. Very well chosen actors and actress. Good acting. A script touching your heart. Nice jokes. OK sometimes it's dirty but. Simply everything is great for sit-com TV-Series. It did not last very long so people not bored. I put HIMYM to my watchlist : 100 TV-Series you should watched before dying. A beautiful written script with a simple shot. Enjoy!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is an amazing show. It has everything you need: comedy, BROmance, friendship and more. I enjoyed it every second. Unfortunately season 9 was a big disappointment. The entire show is build around how Ted met his wife but they actually just spend 5 episodes on how he actually meets her. Feels like they rushed the entire history into the episodes. The entire season is about 55 hours until the wedding. A serious disappointing end for such an amazing show.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is unlike any sitcom i have ever seen on TV, the writers of this show are visionaries. Its hard to explain how great this show is without babbling, so ill start off on why this show is so successful in the first place. 1. The title of the show is actually the whole point of the show, not just some general outline like \"Family matters\", or \"Big Bang Theory\". Ted is telling his children, (which is basically us) the story of how he met their mother and his future wife. 2. Neil Patrick Harris. He adds that spark that makes this show different than any other show, he is not the typical womanizing jack-wagon that you would see on every other sitcom, he has superb acting and plays his part to perfection, whoever came up with the idea he would always wear a suit, or how he would never tell the rest of the cast what he did for a job he just replies a simple \"haha please.\" is ingenious. they couldn't of cast his role more perfectly. 3. Running gags. This show has numerous running gags, Like how I mentioned above, every time one of the cast members ask NPH what he does for a living he simply responds \"haha please\". Or the \"slapbet\", which has been going on since season two, or just the simple things the characters say such as \"Legendary\" or, Suit up! 4. The time line. The fact How I met your mother goes along with real world time gives the show a more down to earth feeling, and gives the feeling like these characters are from another planet and deal with real world struggles like us. 5. Last but not least, and obviously enough, the cast! As i've said before Neil Patrick Harris is perfect for his role but other cast members are not to be overshadowed, Josh Radnor as Ted is a great fit, he is a lovable main character that actually has different emotions, some episodes he is the perfect gentleman, while some he can be, well a bit of a d bag. Jason Segel is great as a best friend, Cobie Smulders as Robin is the main characters first love who fit perfectly into the group but always has her own life going on that the group really never pays attention to. And Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, her character is a bit of an enigma, (ill get to that later.) Now as great as this show is, it does have a few minor flaws. 1. Sometimes it loses focus on what is actually funny and what is well, just pointless. Such as in recent episodes Lily and Marshall practically have their own spin off show, which is fine, but they are not the highlight of the show, they are great with the group but the main focus should almost always be on Ted and Barnie. Now I understand that they need to kill some time so the show could go a season longer, but they could easily make the group go on vacation or do something crazy, there are millions of different ideas. 2.I don't know if the writers purposely do this or if it actually is a mistake, but on some occasions Alyson Hannigan will say something very corny and it is just really bad, and you hear the laugh track laughing and it is just... to put it straight forward, unbearable. And In some episodes she acts like a housewife on a 90's sitcom and it would be better if she just acted like the lovable girl she is most of the time! 3. As i've said before very minor but, in some episodes I feel as if Josh Radnor is depressed and just reading his lines and not even trying to act, but then again that could be part of the show, not everyone is happy all the time, but it is just really depressing to see him like that. But all in all this is the only TV show i've been able to watch for its entire run in the past 10 years! It is genuinely funny and as i've said before, the writers are ingenious! 10/10.\n",
      "1 \t\t It's a great show - a legen ... dary one!I just don't understand why Alyson Hannigan is not in Top Series Cast?\n",
      "1 \t\t I think this show and Love Monkey are perhaps two of the best shows on CBS. Wait scratch that..I think this show is one of the best shows on CBS, since they canceled Love Monkey...if that didn't come out bitter, then i should of tried harder..but you know now, so go back and read it again. OK..ready? Seriously a great show that has a lot of potential in growing. The only person that bothers me in the show is \"Doogey.\" Is he trying to be a twin of Niles? I think the show could be that much better if he suddenly went out of town for a season, or Africa. ( That 70's show reference ) Still the show is funny, and it makes you think of your friends and your life a lot. The characters seem real, and seem like people who you would hang out with. The way it is going I;m real curious on, well, How he meet your mother. I really do hope they don't suddenly cancel this show, cuz i want to see how this all plays out.SAVE THE MONKEY. GO TO CBS.COM, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM AND CLICK FEEDBACK. SAVE LOVE MONKEY!!!!\n",
      "0 \t\t i've never wrote any reviews till now, But after watching \"How I Met Your Mother\", i thought i should definitely write a review about this so called one of the best shows.This show was suggested to me by my brother, when i was watching \"Friends\" TV show, and he said that \"it is considered to be far better show than friends\". So i started watching this show but it wasn't as good as \"friends\". Eventually you get fed up with the main characters except for \"Barney\". I didn't find them funny as the show progressed on, they weren't even funny to begin with. The only character who remained humorous throughout the 9 seasons was \"barney\". The best single lines best pickup lines were from \"barney\" only. I continued watching this show for the sake of \"Barney\" and the hotness of \"Robin\". If it wasn't for barney the show would've been canceled after 2 or 3 seasons. Although this shows is about group of 5 friends, it became \"one man show\" due to \"Barney\" and his \"Legen wait for it...dary\" \"Awesomeness\".Spoiler alert: The ending didn't make any sense and many disliked it because, the ending had to be written before the beginning of the show, regardless the direction which the characters go. cannot blame the creators for the way the show ended. I give this show 7/10 only for the sake of \"Barney\".\n",
      "0 \t\t This series and these Characters will always be in my hurt and they're always are a part from my heart.But when we are talking about season 9 and final of himym! You just can say what happened? Why this happened? Where are the good ending? And there I say we got nothing and nothing.We've got one of the worst and most awful endings.Sadly just we can say a perfect series with a perfect story and Acting group and awful ending a very awful ending.\n",
      "1 \t\t 5-19 and 5-23\n",
      "Series i enjoy watching. There are episodes that I will watch again after years. I haven't watched the dad version yet. I hope it is beautiful.\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't know if I can say something that fill up 10 lines, but I do love this show, it's my favorite comedy so far if I should label it comedy. It's beyond a comedy for me I think. Along with it, I have passed the most important 5 years of my life. I ran into it in 2008 when I was sophomore,since then, I was chasing after it every week. Well I have to admit some of its seasons is not that good. Overall it brings me happiness and tears. I feel and learn how they deal with the relationship among lovers and friends. I can feel warm watching it when I am sad. I feel this guys are kind of my friends in real life. My friends and my wife are also concern about how the story goes. It's part of life for the five years. Well, mom turned out to be dead? Robin and Ted will be together? Oh my.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I first heard of this television series back in 2005 I thought it would be some stupid sitcom that pass of in a couple years, but this series has touched my heart, and used almost every emotion a man can have. I've grown with this group of 5 talented actors as well as the new actress (Cristin Milioti). Just by the on-screen antics, you can tell how close they are in real life. When they started season 9 I was disappointed by a couple of their episodes. I'm glad that they have held out this long to show the mother. It gives us the entire season to know how the mother is without too much showing of her. The mother and Ted seem to be perfect for each other, and I can't wait until they finally meet on March 31st.Thank you for 9 fantastic seasons of the greatest sitcom I've ever watched.\n",
      "1 \t\t Intelligent comedy, romance, drama with absolutely interesting characters. These were simply one of the best TV series I've watched.A lot of episodes, but unlike other series with this many, HIMYM makes you feel like each one of them is part of the story and not a filler.\n",
      "1 \t\t You cannot and should not expect an incredible script like an art series. That was an oldschool TV series, that was a series which you watch at your free time. And for that, it was amazing. The flashbacks were perfect through the whole time. Storytelling was amazing too. Actors were great. I seriously did marathone and finished again in 2 weeks(challenge accepted) and it did not bored me at all.\n",
      "At first, i hated Lily. You know why i say that. But later i liked even Lily.Stinson out\n",
      "0 \t\t So I get off work pretty late and after working all night I at least want to catch an hour of TV entertainment before I go to sleep. At 230 on CW network comes on American Dad, which is a show I can always get more than a few laughs. There goes 30 minutes of ent. 30 minutes to go Right after AD comes this show. Being that there is nothing else on TV at this time, I decide to give this show a try....When I say that this is the most nerve wracking show that was ever created. I mean really. It is really that bad. Most of the time there is no plot, the jokes are awful, and the dialogue between the cast makes you feel like it's an inside joke, and you're on the outside. I don't even attempt to watch this anymore. I instead, after watching AD, play on my phone for 30 mind before going to sleep. Although I don't be watching the show, even hearing them in the background annoys the crap out of me. I just be hearing blah blah blah, and after 5 minutes I can't take anymore. I can compare this show to Its always Sunny in Philadelphia in terms of annoyance. If I'm not visually watching it, hearing all the rambling of the cast voices drives me insane. Always Sunny In Philadelphia however will have me on the floor laughing if I'm actually give it attention. This show just puts me in an irritable mood. Hell even the show that comes on right after this, Rules of Engagement, can make me crack a smile once in awhile. How this have such high ratings, and have been on for countless seasons is was say beyond me\n",
      "1 \t\t I seen some episodes earlier. But this year i started watching it from beginning and it just become a hobby to me. Love this show and especially fan of barney. This show is legend.............wait for it dary.........\n",
      "Legendary. Peace out hombre\n",
      "1 \t\t I absolutely loved the show HIMYM, with great characters, good storyline and great character development. However, one thing that makes my rating for HIMYM significantly lower than it could be is the ending. People watched over 200 episodes, countless hours of the Ted-Robin fiasco, and in the end, they start it again, and on top of that, they do it in the worst way possible:\n",
      "THE FREAKING SMURF PENIS!!!\n",
      "But other than that, this show provided lots of sad, funny and great moments during the time I was watching it. Thanks HIMYM.\n",

      "1 \t\t I mainly wanted to write a review on here defending the show against all of the terribly stupid negative reviewers, but then I realized all of the really bad reviews were from 2005/2006. And now I am just amused by how misguided and just plain blind these people were about this show.How I met Your Mother is one of the best quality sitcoms I have ever seen. Every storyline involving these perfectly cast actors is hilarious and endearing. Honestly, some of the romantic plot lines in this show put most of the romantic comedies that come out in theaters, TO SHAME. One gentlemen compared this show to the likes of Night Court and Three's Company, saying that this show didn't have the spark that made those great. Well I grew up with those shows and while looking back on them may provide fond memories, watching them nowadays you can see how painfully shallow those shows were. This show does much more to get one involved in the relationships of the characters, through good times and bad times, it's not a one off show where everything gets wrapped up and is forgotten about from episode to episode. Nostalgia goggles people, take them off before you speak.A lot of the bad reviews on here predicted that this show would be canceled almost immediately, but it's been 4 years and counting and Jason Segal is now a highly famous and successful comic actor in feature films, and Niel Patric Harris is enjoying cult popularity with the hit Joss Whedon musical Dr. Horrible.So eat your crow past reviewers. People say that sense of humor may be a subjective thing, but not enjoying a quality show like this calls that into question.\n",
      "1 \t\t Well we all know how awesome this show is, like for it humor and that makes you laugh so hard. Honestly I haven't seen FRIENDS yet but I got to tell that this is the most Legend.... Wait for it..... dary.... show of all times and from curiosity I have been bumped to: \"HIMYM vs FRIENDS\" and I would choose HIMYM because besides of it humor it has drama in it that makes it non-commercial and a great show to watch. But as you guys know in that hotness will always be a \"but\" (Season 3 Spoilers), like they say it on an episode when Ted was dating Cathy(The Parrot girl that spoke too much), and this \"but\" is the most unfair thing they did it to the most Legend... Wait for it.... daryy.... characters. And I'm talking about the Slap Bet and the 5+ slaps Barney got from Marshall and OMG, even on his wedding.... Like wait up dude.... it doesn't looks funny because it is unfair. This thing really makes me to stop watching the all show know because it remembers me that Barney will not have the chance to slap Marshall back... why they would do in this way anyway.....? I thought I was giving a 10 to this show but this thing really drives me crazy and I will give it a 9....\n",
      "1 \t\t (WARNING SPOILERS FROM SEASON 3)Well we all know how awesome this show is, like for it humor and that makes you laugh so hard.

      "1 \t\t More than just a comedy show. Good story telling. Amazing plot twists. Barney is legend... ary. Marshals father and son mervins' are amazing.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is hilarious!I enjoy watching this show so much, because it is so well done. The characters are also very funny. But the best character is definitely Barney, he is so freaking hilarious, he does things, i wish i were doing right now!But the different stories in the show is also remarkably good, and you still wonder if Ted is ever going to find his everlasting love for the mother of his children, which the whole show is built on. It's a little bit ridiculous they have called the show \"How I met your mother\", because it is just a cover up. But as soon you start on the show, it doesn't matter, you would rather just watch it, cause it is so good!So SUIT UP! and watch the show, it is all worth it!!\n",
      "1 \t\t A mate of mine recommended this and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a strong pilot and it makes an impression. This shows that you do not need 1 hour to try and make people laugh. The 20+ minutes suffice and the jokes never get old. I think it is because of the cast and their interpretation of the script. Neil, Allison, Josh, Cobie and Jason keep the audience on their toes with their acting. The jokes in this show are funny and not vulgar. It is rare to see something nowadays that does not resort to vulgarity in an attempt to humour. Some of the jokes I even use in every day life and to be frank, I saw most of the episodes 4-5 times... each. I highly recommend it and I hope it gets another season.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show is said to be the most similar sitcom to Friends and The Big Bang Theory and thats why I started watching it. Honestly, I think its nothing, compared to them. I laughed watching a single episode of The Big Bang Theory more than how much I did during a whole season of this show! I stopped watching How I Met Your Mother at third season and I believe I haven't lost anything.\n",
      "1 \t\t And its... wait for it..... S:08 E:20 'The Time Travellers'. I think It could be the perfect ending for the show.\n",
      "As In the episode the group is seen together in the pub with Ted being persuaded by Barney to go with him for a 'legendary' night-out and Marshal & Robin quarrelling over a drink being named after Robin which is actually an idea of Marshall, which is what the show is all about i.e. their friendship and their stories.\n",
      "And in the end, Ted realising it all happening a few years back and now he is all alone in the bar and everyone has moved forward in life with Lily & Marshall with their kid and Barney & Robin being engaged, for which I felt very sad for Ted but by confirming that he will finally meet 'the girl' after 45 days and which they already showed us all along during last few episodes. I think it could make the perfect ending for the show.\n",
      "1 \t\t Neil Patrick- hatsoff buddy..u nailed it as Barney Stinson\n",
      "Alyson-awesome as ever(from american pie onwards)\n",
      "Cobie-one hell of a canadian actress!\n",
      "Jason-You are Funny AF!\n",
      "Josh Radnor-Love you brov! thank you for portraying as Ted Mosby!\n",
      "This show is full of humor and laugh! and it gets better and better with each episode!\n",
      "I dare you to watch this...because its worth it !\n",
      "1 \t\t Oh my god, I can't believe it has so little votes. I mean it has more votes in Czech Movie database. I have to say this, but How I Met Your Mother is legen...wait for it..DARY!! I think it's better than friends( I know most of you don't think so but...It's my opinion). HIMYM is not only funny, it is also very touching and it warms my heart, every time I watch it. Neil Patrick Harris is one of the best comedian actors ever. Of course some episodes are not THAT hilarious, but I think that the least funny episode of HIMYM is still funny. And (you must admit that) doesn't happen so often. So if anyone hasn't watched How I Met Your Mother yet, I think you should change it. Suit UP!!!!!!!\n",
      "0 \t\t Is the end worth it? Nah.The end in some kind of way tries to justify that Ted and Robin should be together. When clearly they did try a hundred times already. So, the plot trying to justify their non-platonic love makes itself look stupid, as if there was something blocking them from being together.\n",
      "It would be great if they really did fit together, like Ted and the Tracy, the Mom in the 8th and 9th season did really freaking fit! But now Ted wants Robin? When the plot clearly showed that he was happy with Tracy? Without even justifying why suddenly he wants Robin instead of Tracy who he had 2 kids with?And the last straw? The kids. The freaking kids. Why would the kids, just like that, agree that \"Hey, our dad likes aunt Robin instead of our mom who they seem to love each other. Dad, go find Robin and tell her you love her!\". Not even Disney stories try to sell you that kind of nonsense. Even they are more realistic than that.Should you watch it?\n",
      "Absolutely. The end has nothing to do with how good the show is. A good ending can just save a bad show, and bad ending can ruin a masterpiece (see Game of Thrones). But this is a sitcom, not a legendary story about Dragons , Queens and Kings. It's a show to make you laugh and relax. So, sit down, get chill and watch it while you make yourself a nice coffee. Or tea, I dont judge.I think it is one of the best, if not the best (for me at least), sitcom show that exists.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just LOVE this show ! It's funny, smart, great... And so cute. The character of Ted Mosby is very likable, bust mostly enlightened by the funniest characters ever around him... Robin is just the girl you'd like to be, and Lilly is so perfect (well everybody knows that Allyson Hannigan is a great actress, or if you don't, i just don't talk to you) because she is so funny and so cool and she has that wonderful mix between masculinity and femininity which is just awesome. And the lines... god ! the lines are great ! To me, it has just the same writing level than FRIENDS and it's a very good concept... Just... watch it !\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't know how to say about this movie. I just wanna say the actors are so beautiful, the voice is so swear. It makes me love this life. I remember a word: \"there are millions of people out there, you just need to go around and find a girl you love.\"\n",
      "1 \t\t When I first of this show on TV in 2005, I was like \"This show seems very interesting\", I started watching it and I loved it but after some episodes I started to think \"hold on\" why does Ted and Robin keep going out together, Why did Barney went out with Ted's ex which is Robin, This keep happening over and over again, For 7 years Lilly and marshal keep arguing about having a baby or not then the finally did it. I just don't understand why Ted's voice is Different, Does your voice change when your an Adult, Do you reach into adult puberty and also what sort of father tell's his children how many wife's he's had sex with. Ted keeps going out with Stella,Barney and the other which I forget her name, She's a doctor. Barney Slept with Marshals fiancé which is Lily, which is just wrong. All this are the negative stuff about the show.The positive stuff about this show is that it has some good jokes, very funny joke, I love barney at times with his \"Legendary\" Jokes, I like their flashbacks, it's pretty funny, It makes you wonder when is Ted going to find his wife so which keeps you watching the show over and over again so yeah.At first I gave this show a rating 8/10 but then I dropped it to a rating 7/10.\n",
      "1 \t\t Love this TVShow, the storyline is great and unusual. Definitely would recommend others to watch it.\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't have much time for TV, so I've been watching Seasons 1-3 on DVD.For me, this is the funniest show I've ever seen. It has the right balance of laughter, wit, and... I don't know.. that \"togetherness\" feeling. You really feel for all the characters.I relate to this show more so than Friends, Seinfeld, and the Cosby Show because I went to college in 1996, and I completely understand all of their references... not because I can connect the dots, but because I actually experienced that time of the year. The writers and actors do an excellent job at portraying the dynamics of the friendships, and what it must be like to grow up as the Saturday morning cartoon kid. Friends, Seinfeld, and Cosby were great shows, but I didn't have the same connection with those shows as I did with this one... not even close. Seinfeld was a bit too vaudeville for me, and Friends was just too unbelievable - it had too many unnecessary jokes and just didn't have the right balance or the proper wit. Cosby and Fresh Prince were great, but I often find them trying to push too many social messages without doing a good job at integrating them into the storyline. But this, this show hits it right on most of the time. All of the characters are well written and developed. Ted and Robin, Lily and Marshall, and Barny... oh Barny... \"Damn It's Good To Be A Banker\". I hope they keep the story and the dynamics going without getting too crazy as most sitcoms usually fall victim to as they get into their 5th-8th season.Favorite Episodes: Slap Bet and Stuff. Favorite \"wait for it\" moments: Barney's crappy play, Ted's first kiss with Robin, Robin's first I love you, Lily's and Marshall's winter wonderland, and so much more.\n",
      "1 \t\t OK, I was unhappy with some hater's review, so here's why I love this show: It's got honest humour, has wonderful characters and makes me feel good. I laughed out loud countless times, -not because I got smacked over the head by some cheesy jokes you might find in any other TV show. I laughed because this one made me care about it's characters and their stories in a smooth and entertaining narrative. I simply feel good when I watch How I Met Your Mother, -because the five of them are funny, lovable, caring and each one in their own way hilarious. It is sensitive comedy and that's very rare to come by these days. Yes, I find Ted annoying at times, or Barney too absorbed in his role or Lilly a bit silly. So what? It's an honest approach(and the result is superb) that reaches out to the audience. The writers don't want to make this one hilarious or a roller-coaster-ride comedy show. They don't have to go over the top to please here. Hard to describe, - but this show just feels refreshingly kind.The narration is a bit lengthy at times, but it's really fun how things tie together through references in later episodes, which amazingly manages to smoothen out things.To make it short: I watch this show when I'm tired, when I feel sad or when I'm sick. It always makes me feel better. And I guess that's all there is to say.If you don't like it, then just avoid it. Calling a show \"overrated\" (after saying that you've watched every episode) sounds more like an agenda to me, -and says more about the reviewer than the show, actually.\n",
      "1 \t\t Guys i'm kinda critic and reticent with comedies but this one is a masterpiece,you will laugh all the way and even learn some things.Its my favorite so far and i belive its a pure 10. You can watch it 3 times and still want to watch one more.Congrats to the movie team and actors!\n",
      "1 \t\t I really like this show. I think it will take a little for it to catch on. I believe it's in it's second season. The chemistry between the cast is really good. Sean Patrick Harris who is more commonly know for his role as Doggie Howser is great as the swinging morel-less bachelor. All the characters are very endearing it is kind of a replacement for friends, and as far as sitcoms on television go it's a really good one. So many of the new shows have bad story lines and the cast has no character, but \"How I met your Mother\" always makes me laugh. The writers are really clever. I like the bar they always go to. It makes for a really funny atmosphere. I think this show is definitely worth watching, I hope it stays on the air for a long time, but I know it will have to fight against the crappy reality television. \"How I met Your Mother\" is a keeper!\n",
      "1 \t\t Contains minor spoilers. How I Met Your Mother has ended",
      ". A series that more than a series was a company, more than six years ago I started watching this story and today the end has come. I read something on the web that said that if someone foreign to the series watches a separated chapter will think that is a funny and charming show, but won't relate much with it. But for those who have followed this series in its whole duration, and becoming a constant thing for so many years, it's a lot more. The in-jokes from the show remain in our heads and every time they reappear they are immediately and happily captured and understood, the same happens with every single detail in the story. Through all that time it was impossible not to become fond, laugh out loud and being touched with each of the characters, with Ted, Robin, Barney, Lily and Marshall. And of course, with the mother, Tracy. Ted, the main character, eternal romantic and pursuer of the love of his life. Robin,in my opinion the best character, the most funny and lovable, and the toughest with emotions. Barney, genius of geniuses, source of thousands of jokes and immortal quotes, amateur magician and a unstoppable womanizer, but loyal friend. Lily, sweeter and most adorable than everyone, and everyone's support friend. Marshall, lover of the supernatural, best friend and life partner. Tracy, the mother of all mothers, the perfect woman for Ted. And thousands and thousands of supporting characters adding very important details and plots. That's the factor that distinguishes HIMYM from other series, at least for me. The connection generated with the characters. Flawed characters with whom you can identify, with comings and goings, problems and difficulties, but as the series left clearly exposed, despite the bumps in the road, all those things are part of something bigger, part of a life of sharing and loving, of friendship and fellowship. And yes, not everything goes as one expects or wishes and in the last chapter this is very clear. People that never change, that make sacrifices to change and that in the end stay exactly the same, for better or worse. And you can tell that this wasn't just the story about Ted and the Mother, it was the story about the entire gang, all of them looking for the same.I've read a lot of texts from angry people unhappy with the way this show ended, and of course, one can be mad because it's a slap of sadness in the face, one very difficult to accept. But if it's well thought and having into account every thing that has happened in this story and specially and simply looking at the personalities of the characters, it's obvious and reasonable that everything comes to this end. From How I Met Your Mother I won't keep the bad reviews of the last season, nor the poor visual effects, nor the useless comparisons to Friends, or any other flaw it has. I will keep what I told before: a story of friends, a life story.\n",
      "1 \t\t Barney's good, rest of the cast is okay and yeah TED is one of the most desperate, pathetic and clingy character I've ever seen. He has no self respect whatsoever.I will not waste time to write minimum words so here comes some bs.The series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York The vast majority of episodes were directed by Pamela Fryman, who directed 196 episodes out of 208. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).Known for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, How I Met Your Mother was popular throughout its run. It initially received positive reviews upon release, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on. The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I start watching the show I think when i will complete it , but when it came to end I don't want to end beacuse i think that I am a part of this.Every character ,Every Episode and Everything is LEGEN WAIT FOR IT DERY .Final Season is My favourite because finally we see haerwarming the heart-Touching moments as came when ted mets the mother and finally he found one .We also have someone waiting for us to be met and I hope We all met our.\n",
      "1 \t\t The nice thing is that, you can view episode 22 as the final chapter. That way, the story is just perfect and nice. But episode 23-24 literally turned over whatever they built up in season 9... But anyway, the whole story still adds up together. Everything seems to work out. According to the timeline, Tracy is not gone yet. Hope they had a happy life.\n",
      "1 \t\t Can't believe I made IMDB account to rate. Trust me it's the best show full of emotions and laughter. It's so adorable and emotional that I felt like crying at the end. It made me believe in love and relationship.\n",
      "This show has beautifully captured all the emotions: joy, laughter, amazement, disappointment, heartbreak you name it, they have it. It has got a lot of life lessons and impacted me in so many ways. I found it very uplifting and it will always be close to my heart. Atlast I'll say this show was \"legand wait for it dary\". Cheers!!\n",
      "0 \t\t I just finished the series, and I don't want to see it again ,they start so well ,,I mean all the effort and thing to get something will be ruined like garbage in next episode ,,,it wil show all the thing that r meaningful in ur life can be droped and start over again\n",
      "1 \t\t Love it how it always makes my day better... i always feel happy when watching it. it's my second favorite show ever! plot is interesting, but i think they should have showed the mother a little more, and she shouldn't die at the end.. the ending was the only dissappointment in that show, but i'm still giving it a ten because it's super good!\n",
      "1 \t\t A comedy series that started out as many other series that came before it, but caught the hearts of so many after it. I really enjoyed watching \"How I Met Your Mother\" for the past 9 years since i literally started watching it since 2005. It was Barney Stinson's amazing and totally different character that really peaked my interest in the show. The writers have made all their fans (including me) wait for so long and actually made us all chase our tails in many occasions, but most of feel that it was totally worth it. I've had so many good memories from the show, the puns, the word plays, running gags and traits, the list goes on. Keeping it simple - i feel that any person who wants to try this sitcom should definitely go for it because it really doesn't bore you and keeps you wanting for more. My only disappointment would be that it felt as though the writers and directors somehow wanted not to finish the show but because of public demand and the \"chasing tail\" had to forcefully finish of the series, the ending could have been a little more longer and fuller. Apart from that, the journey we all took watching this show has been Legen...wait for it....dary!!\n",
      "1 \t\t I absolutely adore the way it's built up, that he talks to his children about how he met their mother. I have not seen a series that's cooler 'built' than this one.I must say, the last two last episodes disappointed me, but apart from that, I don't know a cooler serie.It also has some reality built into it, in some of their \"stupid\" decisions, you can see what they mean, and sometimes even support the stupid things they do.Overall : It's an amazing series, and if you haven't, I'd recommend you to binge-watch it straight through today.\n",
      "1 \t\t Wonderful actors. The chemistry is awesome. Disturbing and sexist script. I wish they had done certain things differently.\n",
      "1 \t\t Absolutely love this show. Everything about it was done perfectly.\n",
      "1 \t\t I decided to check this show out based purely on the fact that Alyson Hannigan, from Buffy the vampire slayer, was in it. I was a huge Buffy fan, Willow was my favorite character, so I figured I'd give the show a chance and see if I could get hooked on a new show that had a familiar face. At first I wasn't too impressed. But I decided to stick with it and I'm glad I did. It took a couple of episodes but I'm totally hooked now. Another reviewer wrote that the show grows on you; well that's exactly what happened to me. Barney is Hilarious! Neil Patrick Harris plays Barney perfectly. His one lines like \"suit up\" and \"Lemon law\" are great, I find myself quoting him constantly. I think the characters are great. I love Marshall and Lily; they're hilarious together and have great chemistry together. Robin is funny, especially when she \"suits up\" and plays opposite Barney. They're great together. Not a huge fan of Ted, but I've always felt that the supporting cast makes the show. And he's slowly growing on me. The show is good and can only get better. The cast has chemistry, the characters are relative, the writing is good, and I'll keep tuning in until the end. Definitely a show worth seeing.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is your tutorial on how to live...how to deal with your problems...it discusses topics and ideas no one has the courage to discuss them....it's not my favorite sitcom but i can assure you that i love the heck out of it and NO I don't think the ending sucks...for so many reasons....I actually find it genius and expresses the message of himym\n",

      "-Tracy McConnell\n",
      "(Ep 16 S9 How your mother met me)Which means that eventually everyone gets their soulmate or someone they love no matter what,what tracy meant that the one she truly loved and was her soulmate was max,her dead boyfriend,whom she didn't wanna marry louis because of him...and before she knew max was dead she was talking about what he got her for her birthday the year before...she said she didn't want the present...but she needed it...foreshadowing that \"the one\" isn't the person you want but the someone you need....max was tracy's robin...he was the one she couldn't get over.\n",
      "(Gonna return back to the whole tracy,max,ted and robin thing)\n",
      "-----\n",
      "2-Speaking of other characters....they got great endings....lily and marshall became great parents with 3 kids....lily became a responsible mother...Marshall became a supreme....there's a huge character development.\n",
      "Barney probably got the greatest character development in history of sitcoms...a person who saw women as an object and was a womanizer...fell in love with robin and felt real love for the first time...became a man who can have a relationship...and thought he was never gonna find the love of his life after he left robin...and became a protective father once he saw his newborn daughter...he wasn't destined to find his \"one\" but he got the chance to have a daughter and love her...from a womanizer to a person who wants to protect his daughter\n",
      "------\n",
      "3-about Robin&Barney....i agree that they were the perfect couple...but barney wasn't the one for Robin...She always thought that she should be with Ted...and there marriage wasn't a failure...it actually made them change and find what they actually want...Robin wanted her career and she wanted to be better in her job...Barney wanted to settle down in NY...It was a successful marriage that only happened to last 3 years only...and they ended it on a good note and both of them stayed friends....the divorce happened because life gets in the way...robin starts traveling a lot which changes the couple's dynamic so they break it off...that doesn't deny the fact how much they loved each other...the divorce was just an end to a 3 year successful marriage.....just like ted and tracy...yes ted went back to robin...but that doesn't deny how much he loved tracy...it's just life that got in their way again....they had a successful marriage that only happened to last 4 years until life got in their way\n",

      "4-Robin was the one for Ted from the beginning...he literally started the story from the day he met her...ngl i was never a fan of ted&robin together...but after finishing the finale and looking back to all the build up...all the important scenes throughout the whole 9 seasons....everytime each one of them wanted the other but couldn't get them at that moment...it makes more sense why they still wanted each other....ted loved tracy so much because she was his dream girl who plays bass and nerdy and collects coins...she was the one he wanted...but she was never robin whom he needed....ted decided to let go of robin for barney because he's his bsf and because he actually loved robin and he just wanted her to be happy...as proof...ted gave us a speech about love which was (Actually, there is a word for that. It's love. I'm in love with her, okay? If you're looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want, no matter how much it destroys you, it's love! And when you love someone, you just, you don't stop, ever. Even when people roll their eyes or call you crazy. Even then. Especially then! You just- you don't give up! Because if I could give up if I could just, you know, take the whole world's advice and-and move on and find someone else, that wouldn't be love. That would be that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for. But I- that is not what this is)\n",

      "People who are mad ted and robin are back are the same people who are happy with Rachel and ross getting back...they're pretty much the same thing...i was happy with both but himym had a build up for 9 seasons...friends's build for ross and rachel was sloppy and fast and the reason people love it is because you wanted that to happen no matter how....in himym you only wanted the mother so you missed out on every detail about ted and robin complicated drama\n",

      "*spoilers for friends and the office*\n",
      "5-The gang's break up was different than other sitcoms...for an example...the office ended with everyone leaving dunder mifflin...which they did in an awesome way and a probably it was the best sitcom ending...friends ended with the gang breaking up so everyone can live the life they want or continue the life they are starting all at once...which wasn't bad at all and was great...but himym was more realistic....what can break a gang of friends gradually while growing up? Work,responsibility,kids and complicated relationships with friends ....these four were the main factors of the gang breaking up....lily and marshall didn't hang out much because of their kids...robin wouldn't go out anymore because of work and because her ex husband and the one she should be with but he has a wife now...and putting the show beside for a moment...that's how gangs actually breakup...growing up has its cons...one of them is that you'll never get back and be young and stupid again...and that's what held the gang...they were young and stupid and didn't have much responsibility...and it's never gonna be how it was....friends you had while you're young will fall away and maybe not all of them but some will fall way...that was just another lesson the show gave us but no one realized\n",

      "1 \t\t I absolutely love this show. It has definitely taught me a thing or two about life. I understand many people, including myself were upset about the finale episode but I think that's acceptable because the rest of the show is pure gold. It's actually funny, quite realistic and the amount of character development (excluding everything that happened in the last 5 minutes of the finale) is phenomenal. It most certainly is NOT a rip off of friends and pretty much the only thing common about the two is a group of friends living in NYC. There's a storyline that sticks from start to the end which makes it even more better. Definitely something to watch before saying that friends is the best sitcom ever.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love Alyson Hannigan, for instance, I asked my friends to call me Willow from Buffy. I am glad she made a new T.V. show and this one actually suits her! I saw 'Best Prom Ever' just then and it was quite funny. I have only seen a couple of episodes but that would have to be the funniest yet. Well Done on your 92386738467345671563571648362 success Alyson. (I don't even know what that number is...!) Alyson plays Lily. A little redheaded naive kindergarten teacher who is marrying her fiancée' Marshall. Things get tough when Ted loses his girlfriend, Victoria, and fall's for Robin, a sexy news reporter who has always had a crush on Ted. Barney is a sexed-up-suited-up-loser. He only thinks of girls naked and what he can do for them! He is a very naive.I just wanna congratulate Aly for this great achievement because she plays a fantastic character in such a funny/great show. Honesty, it is like Buffy, and Buffy is like a drug.

      "0 \t\t A show about about terrible people who are terrible. It's depressing and not funny. A gay guy talks about banging women, not fooling anyone. Again, terrible characters, not like Seinfeld terrible people, these people just suck. So I'm not a fan obviously. Nobody in the history of the world acts like these a-holes. Who writes this garbage? Why is Bob Saget the one idiot years later? Why not just have the dude do his own voice over? Something about this show makes me feel awful, makes me dislike people who would act like these jerks. I looked up the ending, whatever, the ending should have had them all locked up in prison.......like another much better show. Cheers!\n",
      "1 \t\t Brilliant comedy. No episode disappoints. Funny from start to finish.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is a great series, that really resonated with me, since I'm was studying architecture, one of my best friends is a lawyer and I pretty much have a circle of friends with good game =)The most entertaining characters were Barney and Marshall and it was very consistent in it's episodes.\n",
      "Everyone had a great short story, that filled you up with drama, laughter, tragedy, emotions, and short on spot humour. All that said, ...the final season was horrible. \n",
      "Each episode felt like a filler episode, which ultimately ended with the worst 2 episodes ending ever. It all just felt rushed, with some strange, lazy twists. Even the acting felt... forced.Sorry, if I'm being a bit emotional, but ultimately, was a great show, that I would totally rewatch!\n",
      "1 \t\t Dec. 2006 - This awesome show has hit its stride. If you haven't been watching this show, what is wrong with you? This is the only CBS show on my DVR. And the only other shows I regularly record - Lost, Desperate Housewives, and Fox TV Sunday Night animated block. This show is as good, if not better, than any of those.The recent episode that introduced us to the slap bet and Robin Sparkles was brilliant. And Wayne Brady playing NPH's brother in another episode - hysteric - wait for it - al. And Swarley. Classic. And Lily moving into Barney's. Wow! Each of the actors is perfectly cast and willing to do whatever it takes to make the show great. (One look at Robin Sparkles tells you that!) Yet at the same time, you care about these characters and can identify with them.\n",

I don't know why even she is in the whole season. I watched 4 seasons of the show, the 2nd last episode of season 4 was just annoying. she asked robin to express fake feelings to barney so that he forget you and after she does and barney moves on, she tells barney that robin was faking i mean what the hell, she broke up Ted and robin too. I have decided not to watch it anymore because lily is there till end and i can't see her anymore. the 3 stars I have given. Two for Barny and 1 for Ted\n",
      "1 \t\t This is very good How I Met Your Mother is one of the funniest shows ever I don't see any problems with the show the show is funny there's a bunch of this funny hilarious moments that make even I want to laugh watch the whole entire season and it's the funniest most coolest thing I've ever watched How I Met Your Mother is a show that I repeat watching over and over just to show him how funny it is and how hilarious and how equally demeanor and funny it is I think this show does very well it's funny and it's comical jokes in the way it's done so they can be a little off- putting and sometimes you can scare me but he'll the jokes are actually kind of funny and I do love to watch this over and over I gotta come to an end but hey the show has a bunch of Comedy funny nurse and a hell of a lot of stuff that you love to see in any type of these kind of shows I want to see this show ever I want the show to continue and bring back what it needed to do the show as one of the best and funniest shows ever How I Met Your Mother Like I said and a short good version is one of the best funniest smartest coolest comedy ever it is one of the coolest one ever I'm glad that I watched it is not a waste of my time it is one of the best\n",
      "1 \t\t Watched when I was in my early 20s found it very funny but never finished the series.Finished the series on Netflix recently - now in my 30s thought it was a great series. I remember hating Ted's character when I first watched it but on re-watching I had a much different perspective on the characters. I might have hated the ending if I had watched it when I was younger but though I was quite a fitting end to the series.\n",
      "0 \t\t It's one of the most boring shows I have ever seen. I gave it a try because so many people told me it's a great show. Although the actors make a good job, the character's personality is poorly built and the plot is really slow and often without making much sense. With other shows, I can relate to some of the characters, understand their reactions and laugh with the clichés that they create and others that we all know. Then, all shows also have some other \"tricks\" to make you laugh, like visual jokes, slapsticks, or the always effective weapon of repeating the same joke over and over again. But since the first episode, I come to the conclusion that this show would be dead if they couldn't repeat the same sentence again and again. Most of the time it's all they have to make you smile. And then many times there are long scenes where not much happens, with no \"rhythm\" whatsoever, where they use background music so you don't die of boredom, just like in elevators. All in all, in my opinion, it's a show where the writers tried (maybe too hard) to create a sitcom that makes you laugh and think, but so many times it's just a mix of sadness and boredom.\n",
      "1 \t\t This sticom is amazing, the characters are great, the plot development is incredible, but the ending is terrible. The staff really made me sit through 9 long seasons to get a quick two episode ending that undoes the entire plot. Robins character ruined the plot.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is the best and totally worth it i love it\n",
      "1 \t\t The whole show is honestly an awesome series full of legendary stuff. but that last 2 minutes of the show is soooo ruining it\n",
      "1 \t\t Well, the last 3 pages almost exclusively contain bad reviews. I for one love the show.Yes, it's almost all been done before, the characters can be linked to several characters in comedy history, but get over it. We have nearly seen it all, kinky characters, rich playboys, couples with the female as a dominant, guys desperately looking for love,... but we will have to learn and live with that, we've seen a lot of shows and it's impossible to bring 5 believable COMPLETELY original characters!The show is well brought, played by a strong young cast (no A-actors, and maybe not on par with the Friends cast, but very good) and very funny, even when using clichés.Ignore the few bad comments on here, look at the overall rating it's got and see the show to rate for yourself. It would be a big mistake to let this show pass and you'll miss out on a lot of laughs.They're running season 5 atm, and I hope they'll do a lot more.\n",

Im just trying to type as much as possible because if i dont fill up 600chars i wont be able to post it so nvm and and go watch the office best comedy ever and it is revolutionary in its genre.

      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) has been on the air for years now, but I have only just crawled out from under the rock I apparently lived under to discover its hilarity. As soon as I finally got around to checking the show out, I fell in love. HIMYM has a refreshing catchy concept at the center, the familiarity of construct (including a laugh track), and a fantastic cast to recommend it. The refreshing method of telling the story from the future (in the voice of Bob Sagat no less) allows for hilariously fungible time lines—and what a great hook! Doesn't everyone at some point ask how his or her parents met? While the show does come across as a bit of a Friends set in a bar, the concept of the show has at it center a drive that Friends and so many other sit coms lack. The show is the story of a time when your friends are your family but it is also the story of the time when you're ready to settle down but don't have someone to settle down with. The character of Ted is endearing enough and Sagat's voice over is funny enough that it makes the viewer really want to know how he meets the mother of his children. Finally, the awesome cast at the center of HIMYM. The cast includes two previously (relatively) unknowns such Josh Radnor as the central Ted, and Colbie Smolders as the perfect woman. The pair are delightful both together and separately. Each is at the center of some awesome story lines (for Ted see \"The Pineapple Incident\" and I'm partial to Robin in any of her turns as \"Robin Sparkles\" Canadian pop-star especially in \"The Slap Bet\" and \"Sand Castles in the Sand\"). Jason Segal is known from Freaks and Geeks and any number of other Judd Apatow projects. Segal plays Marshall who is a law student/lawyer and in a long-term committed relationship. Segal is the hilarious best friend to Ted and good-hearted foil to Barney. Segal has great story lines played with both heart and hilarity (see \"The Duel\" and \"The Best Burger in New York\"). The other half of Segal's Marshall is Alyson Hannigan's Lily. Hannigan is best known from her Buffy and American Pie days. Lily is the wannabe painter turned kindergarten teacher who is both hilarious and lovable as the gooey girlfriend and only real source of femininity in the show (for great Lily episodes see the B story in \"Sweat Taste of Liberty\" and \"The Front Porch\"). Last but most assuredly not least the one and only Neil Patrick Harris. NPH is the fantastically amusing, magic-trick performing, bro-code writing, catch phrase shouting, and man whorish Barney. There are no end of fantastic Barney episodes and the signs point to more great episodes to come (for great Barney episodes see \"The Bracket\", \"Zip, Zip, Zip\", \"Game Night\" and \"Benefits\"). The show is currently tying to find its way into a 5th season hook but the season is shaping up. Definitely go back to the season one because HIMYM is the kind of show that rewards its long-term viewers by inside jokes and past season references. The show is definitely worth checking out.\n",

      "1 \t\t It's the third time I'm watching it, It's an amazing show but minus 1 point because I noticed something about Lily's character,even though sometimes she gave the best advice and helped her friends I think she was a very manipulative person and i kinda hated that.\n",
      "1 \t\t The best ever series I have seen. It has many twist, lots of fun, so much emotions and last but not the least rommance. How a sitcom turns into a rommance the show is a perfect example of it. I suggest every to watch this. (Even in real life i also suggest this) . Perfect balace and more realistic story gives the show a new dimension.\n",
      "1 \t\t I can easily say that himym is the best sitcom i have ever watched. If you want to watch something fun you should give it a shot. I watched it 3 times already and some scenes still makes me laugh even tho i have seen it for hundreds of times when i had a bad day and watched that episode. Its mostly makes you laugh but i also cried in some episodes.\n",
      "1 \t\t OK, so my friend introduced me to this show a while back ago, and, though it was funny, I was not impressed with it. Just another boring sitcom that tries to be funny, and.... I never tried watching it. Wrong! I began watching it lately, for real this time, and all I can say is: LEGEN-DARY. This show is amazing! It's one of the funniest shows ever and I just love how all the characters click together and just work. I couldn't believe that people actually didn't like this show. I know everyone has different opinions, but, I don't know, but this show rocks! I love it! And I am glad to say this is one of the only T.V. shows that I actually watch nowadays, and more importantly, enjoy.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just finished the HIMYM and all I can say is that you can learn a lot of things from the characters' experiences. I very much liked the characters, they had a lot of depth.\n",
      "The final episode just blew me off, I didn't expect Ted to back together with his best friend, and I can understand why people are angry about this show. Season 9 went so fast and it doesn't allow you to process some things, like ' why Barney and Robin broke up?' in the next episode after their wedding.\n",
      "From the 1st episode of this show, I thought that maybe it'll be a cliche where Ted will be refused by Robin and she will hang out with the gang while Ted will have a lot of disappointments from his relationships, and in the end, both of them will realize that they could be together. So during the 8th seasons, I was more and more focused on the idea that Ted will really meet 'the girl', so I had a lot of reasons to think that there was no love between Ted and Robin. I had a lot of reasons to think that they don't match each other because they tried but it didn't felt quite good for them (that's why neither Barney and Robin's relationship didn't work).\n",
      "I felt like all of Ted's struggles to change his mindset about relationships and attachments were in vain. He didn't let go of Robin before the wedding like he was telling himself, everything was about her even from the beginning. Somehow I felt like Ted was too obsessive about his past with Robin and he didn't learn to get over, he was to insecure and the story he was told to his kids and even to us was a big lie. I wanted to explain what bothered me for justifying my 9/10.\n",
      "So, all I can say is that the show was awesome and very funny, even if the story from the final episode felt unrealistic to me. I wanted to rate it with 10 but I changed my mind, 9 is the best score I could give.\n",
      "1 \t\t Overall a great series. It's hard not to compare to Friends with its similarities and has that rewatchable aspect. I enjoyed the characters and their story lines across the 9 seasons. Barney especially is an amazing character and continued to have me laughing throughout. Unfortunately the ending doesn't do the series justice but putting that aside it is definitely an enjoyable experience and easy to watch. I would certainly recommend it.\n",
      "1 \t\t S1 to 5 or 6, it gets boring from time to time because it's just a repetition. But in the end, everything comes together and when he finally met their mothers, it'a heartwarming and moving because I felt like I saw everything he went through. It could happen to anyone, finding the one is definitely not easy and sometimes friends around you who didn't want that get there faster. But this sitcom makes me remind that everything happens for a reason and there is always the right timing for each person. Obviously this is very good as a sitcom too :)\n",
      "1 \t\t Everyone says that friends is the best sitcom, but c'mon! If i had time, i would rewatch this show for the third time!!! The iconic role, ted, is such a sweetheart and the first season may be boring, but trust me, just watch it.\n",
      "0 \t\t First off I'm not gonna lie the show is very entertaining,(most episodes),but the characters are very bad,the way the characters develop is horrible,barney was a great character until like season 4,Marshall is alright,ted is a simp,robin is boring,LILYyyyyyyyy,lily is the worst character i have ever seen on tv(after cat woman of course) she is basically a B I T C H and alyson's style of acting is so bad, really really bad,it's like I'm watching a twelve year old girl acting it's just bad,you can't watch 10 episodes without cringing at least once,season 9 shouldn't exist.\n",
      "0 \t\t It is kind of Indian Serial in a sophisticated way. Start somewhere and goes somewhere with the story. You dont want to meet or know who the mother is after some season. Ted want \"the one\". Ted loves Robin, Barney loves Robin, Robin loves Ted when somebody else loves Robin. Robin loves Barney when Barney loves someone. Someone like 2nd person when 3rd person loves someone. And vice versa. It is like a trap seeing this series. Seeing 8th season and 12th episode and still I dnt know what they are doing. Lilly and Marshel gives some comfort. Poor character development for all the lovers of Ted. They can do 100 season like this. This is what I get for scolding my mom for seeing stupid Indian serials. I want to stop this but I cant, for one reason- episodes are 20 mins only.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother has been around for a good 6 years now and is going as strong as ever. How I met your mother is most comparable to Seinfeld, possibly the greatest sitcom of all time. The way Seinfeld kept up its enjoyment factor was through its comedy and brilliant cast. Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson brings much of the enjoyment to the show, his character is much like that of Kramer's. Crazy, Stupid, always taking advantage of other characters yet still a great friend. Other comparisons to Seinfeld are the sometimes nonsensicle plot lines, ending in madness. In order to make an enjoyable sitcom, the characters must face interesting and amusing situations, How I met your mother fulfils this task, just as Seinfeld and Malcolm in the Middle have done in the past. At least it hasn't fallen into a rut, much like Friends did from season 1, using dull, predictable story lines episode after episode.(and still became so popular, which is beyond me)\n",
      "1 \t\t This show has 5 well developed characters that will lead it to a long run. The shows premise is a great and smart idea for a show. The group consists of Ted, the hoping romantic, Marshall, the best friend and fiancé, Lily, Marshalls eccentric fiancé, Barney, the always interesting womanizer and Robin, Teds first canidate and promising news reporter. My favorite episode of the show is the pineapple incident from season 1. It was well written and has many events you can probably relate to. My favorite moment was when the gang found out Robins secret life. I wish best of luck to this show considering it is my favorite show on TV right now!\n",
      "1 \t\t Some laughs here and there, but other than that i would rather watch \"Friends\" over and over again.\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the all of its episodes actually the ones with barney doing all the crazy stuffs. I am gonna miss The bro code, suit up, play book by barney. I don't think the producers should have ended this series just now but what can you do.But it has a happy ending Ted getting back with Robin. As some of the review suggest The show must go on showing or a new series should start the mother side how she met Ted. Even if they made that it's not gonna be that legendary without Barney. I liked NPH as Barney that every time I see NPH in a movie or other TV series I expect him to say legendary suit up or hit on any random girl on screen.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show became a part of my life. I couldn't have enjoyed it anymore than I did. I felt as if i was living with Ted, Lilly, and Marshall in the apartment. Being a part of all the jokes and knowing the characters so well made me wish I was sitting in the booth with all of them. I have to admit I was shocked by the ending. If I had know it ended with Ted and Robin when I first started watching, I would have been ecstatic. But as time went on, I enjoyed the thought of another women, and Robin and Barney's future marriage made the show feel complete. But then the killed off the mother, the women who was suppose to make Ted's life complete and who he would live with in his house. I wish the jokes could continue but after the last episode, the show feels completed.\n",
      "0 \t\t My rating would have been a 10 if not for the wretched, horrible, awful, terrible finale.\n",
      "1 \t\t At s4. I reaaaaaally like the characters. Very adorable. So silly and charming. The actorsr are great. Sooo much easier to get into than Friends. The jokes are actualy funny. Its easy for them to do their jobs. Its not forced humour. I didnt laugh just once or twice. Its really good. Rare I like more than one character unlike Perks of recreaction where i only like Leslie and Amber. So my top 3: The Office, HIMYM and New girl.\n",
      "0 \t\t The show is very very promising and in it's own way, original. At first I thought that it would be a \"Friends\" clone, but fortunately I was wrong. The characters are well developed, the script is well written and the actors are great. What I mostly enjoy is the way they \"mock\" their own culture (the constant use of Awesome and Totally plus the character of Barney, make a good example of the sarcasm) Really worth watching and giving it a chance. The characters really make the show different, the fact that there is man who actually wants to get married (+marshall that makes 2), a woman who doesn't want to get married (Robbin), Barney himself is a very original character and finally Lily is a woman who may have had only one man her whole life, and has a long term relationship and wants to get married etc etc etc, she likes dirty jokes, she likes being kinky, and she is kinda a tom-boy. I hope that the show will stick around for a few more seasons!\n",
      "1 \t\t What can I say? I'm a sucker for Neil Patrick Harris. He is, without a doubt, a funny funny guy. Anyone ever see his stellar job in Starship Troopers? He's the type of smarmy guy who I love to be friends with and has all of the best one liners on the show. I'm not actually all that interested in Ted, who the show is nominally about. I think that like Meredith on Grey's Anatomy, he's a whiny little person(rhyming with 'stitch') who can't wake up and see that he has a great life. I mean really. A good job, wait... What does he do again? Is his job like Chandler's on Friends? Great friends who support him in whatever he does, and a seemingly endless line of girls looking to hook up with him, a nice apartment. (ok, it's not a terrific apartment, but better than mine) The ridiculous situations that constitute each show really make it worth while, especially Barney's \"help\" for Ted.\"Have you met Ted?\"\n",
      "1 \t\t Its first TV series I watched in English. Its soon good for learning English. Really. And I love this series all episodes. Acters like my friends. Love USA.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I started watching the show, at first it kinda seemed like an adaptation of friends. But as I kept watching, I understood it wasn't. It was rather a lot resembling to our real lives. Like, the character Ted Mosby, I found him like me. Planning on something, but always end up not getting everything according to the plan. Then somehow he manages to get something better. Anyways, the show is awesome in many ways. I totally recommend watching it.\n",
      "1 \t\t I stumbled across this show when trying to find episodes of NPH as that young doctor but didn't find it so me and some friends started watching this instead. And from the first episode we were hooked.The cast is amazing and they create probably one of the funniest shows to air on television in recent memory. The characters of Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin are all great but wait for it... the best character is the best looking most perfect person alive,thats right, Barney. Every second of screen time he has is as he would himself describe it Awesome! I realize this show might not be for everybody but even my 50 year-old parents laughed a lot at certain aspects. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to experience the funniest 25 minutes television has to offer and in many cases you will find yourself discussing similar things as the cast do like phone-fives, boob-zoo's, and just generally suiting up!I hope no one reading this is lactose intolerant because the second part of this last word is dairy... LEGENDARY!!!.THANK YOU NPH\n",
      "1 \t\t The best thing about this show is the characters, and their relationship together, thats what makes the show one of the best comedy series's ever, and of course its funny but i liked their relationship more.\n",
      "1 \t\t Do you ever notice that when you watch a film or TV show over and over it might be good the first time around, but after watching a couple of times you see flaws in acting, writing, etc. Generally if it is a good film or show it is still worth watching re-runs over and over, but you do notice the mistakes. I currently live overseas and watch How I Met Your Mother re-runs on Fox Satellite. I have seen all of the first six seasons of the season numerous times and I am repeatedly amazed at how good this show is. I am sorry not good, excellent! It comes down to three things, incredible acting, phenomenal writing and exemplary editing. There are a lot of really good TV shows over the last decade (i.e. Dexter, Breaking Bad, and Justified, among others), but Mother is one of the best. Funny, smart, sexy, little stories about five friends and countless other hilarious characters that envelope a larger story that you will enjoy watching again and again. 10 out of 10 stars.\n",
      "1 \t\t First of all I loved this Show and I think directors and writers did very well. I love Ted, Barney and Robin more then others, especially Ted, when he want married with Robin and she didn't want, I cried a lot, although Ted knew that he loves her however he helping Barney to married with Robin, it's so tragic, I think the end of show is good, early of Show I told myself why Ted saying to kids how I met your mother while all about Robin, it's obviously because the show trying to say that how Ted met Robin. anyway, I laughed a lot with Barney and enjoyed this show but definitely what it's important to me in this show is emotional part.\n",
      "1 \t\t If you want some fun in your life then must watch this amazing series from sitcom. Loved it.\n",
      "0 \t\t I think it didn't happen. Because the name of the show should have been how I met Robin instead of how I met your mother. Also, although it is a comedy series, it is constantly trying to pull you in and confuse you like in the movie Inception. you forget to laugh and start thinking to solve the plot. The cast is great, the acting is excellent, but the script is too lacking. and the last season sucks.\n",
      "1 \t\t At first when I saw this show I thought it was stupid, but then I watched a few episodes and it grew on me. After a while, you fall in love with each character and root for their problems to be resolved. Especially concerning Ted, each episode he gets closer and closer to telling Robin how he feels, each time you want him to succeed more and more. His connection with Robin is much like that of Ross and Rachel on Friends. After about three episodes I liked Lily and Marshell the best. There cute sense of humor and understanding of each other while others do not is amazing. The two actors that play these characters have so much chemistry, that you feel as if they are real. Then there is Barney, who is the lovable, fun, single guy of the show. You cannot help but laugh at Barney as he goes through his ridiculous daily routines. I love this show and cannot wait for next season!\n",
      "0 \t\t Yup,its good. Atleast until the last season. A wedding dragged for 20 episodes is way too much and in the end to find out that it was all meaningless is just waay too sad. 20 episodes of the wedding and they just get divorced. Too lame. Could have spent that time on something else. But overall its good. Could have had a better ending though.\n",
      "0 \t\t When I started the show it seems to be great with a wonder full chemistry between the character and great humour but as the show progress towards the end it completely lost it plot and also it become so very boring . It should have been stop after season 6 but it gradually dragged its story line until the 9th season. Barney Stinson is the best character according to me and was the the only reason to finish the whole show. Most importantly the name suggest story of Ted meeting his better half but actually \" the mother \" has a cameo in the very last season. So the name of the should have been \" How I met Your Aunt Robin\"\n",
      "1 \t\t I love himym so much is really my comfort show I'm watching it for the third time.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've got a wired thinking that Barney will be hunted by North Korean Assassins in this new coming season. Why? Cause that'll be so much fun! We've seen many times that Barnacle got SO SO freaky when anything came up that related to his work. And the director has always managed to keep his job in such a secrecy and mystery. 3 seasons have been shown but no one still knows nothing about Barnacle's little secret job?!! Come on, you've got to be kidding me... Let me put it this way: If I could, I would definitely go over to Pyongyang, getting on my knees, begging Kim Il-sung,the great Chairman of NK, to send us an assassin to come after Barnacle. Not that I do not love him,but cool people ought to have such things happen to them. Who knows what'll happen? Barnacle gets panic,freaks out and asks for help from his best friends. God knows how eager I'm to see how these lovely people will respond to this situation. Or otherwise, Kim Il-sung made an mistake and send over a hot female assassin after Barney. Hah ha~ Thus we get an new competitor for the Guess-Who-Got-Screwed-By-Barney-Most-Badly Competition. Albright would be no match for our new hot killer. Summing up,it'll be legen~~~~~~~~ eh~guys, you all know the words. PS:Anyone seen the above who think I'm talking crazy, please,please show me some understanding. It's been so long since I last saw any new episodes of HIMYM, thus missing the sole source of joy of my life.\n",
      "0 \t\t I wanted barney and nora to last. They were so good together.\n",
      "1 \t\t DARY, this show is LEGENDARY. Always fun to watch, great cast, great humor and perfect for relaxing while watching. It's clear it's only comedy and trying to picture the life of adults growing up in a fantastic Metropole like New York City in a funny way with all highs and downs in life so don't expect something profound. How I met your mother as a show has his own humor and Charme, his own tempo, his own story telling but always close to reality on an excessive funny way.Too bad this show came to an end long time ago, but sometimes you have to stop when things are at their best.Stinson over ;)\n",
      "1 \t\t Before I start let me say I don't often review to shows but I felt this one was worth doing. The creators Craig Thomas and Carter Bays set out to make a show with obvious direction and ending point.A show with wit, one liners and funny recurring gags brought to life by such esteemed actors and actresses. But it was more than this, the music especially is what makes the show for me, because this sitcom is more than just laughs. The clear emotional narrative is often commonplace in many sitcoms especially based around a group of 30-odd aged friends. Its inevitable characters are forced together. The music however is used in the most memorable way to a point where I hear songs and it reminds me of these iconic moments.People often claim this show was ruined by its last season and subsequent episode, I felt this strongly straight after watching it. But in reflection I think it was the perfect ending, it was not the perfect ending in terms of the characters but that's what made the show good. The outcome was not what is expected which is what makes it feel real. Every story doesnt have the happy ending we want.This show is well worth the watch, everyone I have recommended it to enjoys it bar the finale. If opinions aren't polarised then things are too safe. Hilarious for random episodes but a perfect story to watch from start to end!!!\n",
      "0 \t\t The pilot let me down but I forced myself to give the series a try, watch some more. I gave it up after the first 3-4 episodes. Jokes aren't funny at all, scenes are predictable. I don't know if it gets any better and I guess I never will. It felt almost like I was watching a bad copy of Friends.\n",
      "1 \t\t Alright, I don't usually write reviews, but I've just watched the last episode of the series, the 9th season 2 part finale, and I can just say I was blown away. This is one of the greatest, most heartwarming, funny, brilliant show I've ever seen. The characters are just amazing, they kinda grow on you, you just absolutely love them and care about what happens to them, and they sorta mature and develop throughout the show. And their friendship, its something so special, with so many good times, you just kinda wish you had the same thing they have, the same relationship with some people, and you absolutely learn a lot from it. You learn to cherish your own friends, and the people closest to you. I mean, I'm just sad that the show ended, I'm just sad that I wont get to see them anymore, and I've watched the show twice. The Finale was great, some of my friends actually said some bad stuff about it, they didn't like it for some reason, cause of certain things, I'm not gonna spoil, but for me, it was still amazing, I mean, when I see the group together I feel so cozy. All in all, this show has had a great impact on my life, and I'm gonna remember it for the rest of my life. This show is awesome!\n",
      "1 \t\t LEGENDARY , Because It follows a course of events, unlike the others\n",
      "Ps : I just watch friends, seinfeld , the big bang theory and Himym.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show shows what can happen when talented actors strut there stuff. To be honest, the comedy in this show is great friends comedy. If you are in college or in your 20s, you will love this show. Most people probably won't find it funny, but if you do, you laugh very hard. Unlike other comedy's, this targets that audience who love friends comedy. It isn't like 2 half men or the office. It doesn't try to appeal to every person. It focuses on one demographic and hits it them over the head. I like this better then office and 2 and a half man, because it is sex comedy and relationship comedy. no weird comedy of the office and no classic comedy like men. THIS show just rocks. The actors are famous from other things. Allison was awesome in Buffy, Jason segel was awesome in freaks and geeks, and NPH was awesome in anything he is in. Give it a chance. Watch 3 episodes then make your decision.\n",
      "1 \t\t Although many people hated the end and say it ruined the show, this is probably my favorite TV show ever! Seeing this friendship evolve over 9 seasons is amazing. It makes you think about your own life, and the things you have experienced, the good and the bad. For me this show will be forever in my hearth and I will keep rewatching it as the years go on!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your Mother started out being a really great show and was always hilarious. The characters were great especially Ted, Robin, and Barney (Lily was the only bad character). All of the episodes were funny. The show started off good and got continually better until it hit its peek at season 4, season 5 was still good but was the last of the original good seasons. Season 6 was where the show really started to show that it was on the decline but was still funny as the characters were still good. Season 7 and 8 were all filler episodes dragging out the show trying to take advantage of its popularity. The characters weren't even funny like they were before because everything about the episodes were so needless. The show is only still worth watching because you care for what the characters originally were.\n",
      "1 \t\t I was initially drawn to watching this series with Alyson Hannigan's and Neil Patrick Harris's names on it. After watching the first few episodes, I thought it was just a formulaic Friends-like show, and I somehow understood why some of the others who left comments here keep referring to this show as the next Friends phenomenon. Well, I didn't really like Friends that much. After finishing off the first season, I have found this series to be definitely better than Friends, and with definitely better writing too - not typically comical, really edgy and pretty sensible.I like the way how the whole plot has been cooked up. There's the big plot arc - covering the entire title and making a guessing game as to who's going to end up as the mother, and then there are the mini plot arcs of how the other women shown in this series became significant in how Ted found his wife, or at least, the mother of his children. Creative story telling like this is not that original, I admit, but it adds more value to the entire series especially if it has been \"cooked\" just right.Alyson Hannigan is very sweet and lovable for her role and Neil Patrick Harris brings a little bit of the Ian Stark personality (from Stark Raving Mad) into the mix. It's very refreshing to see him play the other side of the fence for this series and I think he does that wonderfully. I can't say much about Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders but they're good enough, I think. I just feel that their acting definitely leave room for improvement. It's a good thing they're both very attractive though, makes the little acting problems a little less noticeable if I may say so in a polite way.I'm definitely hooked on this show. Yes, the cast is fine and dandy but it's the story - along side the entertaining way it is being told - that really makes this show very worth it. Congratulations to everybody in the production crew and the cast.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) is one of the shows I started to watch to forget F.R.I.E.N.D.S so that I can watch that again. Few episodes made me feel it was not near F.R.I.E.N.D.S at all, but slowly it grew on me and made me realise both though belong to \"rom-sitcom\" are different in their own ways. I really missed Barney at the end of the show. I don't want to compare it with F.R.I.E.N.D.S or any other rom-sitcom for that matter as each sitcom is special in its own way and different theme. It is really a worthy show to binge upon despite the fact that alternate ending was way better. I would recommend watching it irrespective after/before F.R.I.E.N.D.S because you would love this too.\n",
      "1 \t\t i have to say,having watched friends first,this sitcom which resembled friends in a lot of ways did not impress me a lot. however,as i came to season 3 i really started loving it.it slowly began to grow on me. i loved its quirky ,eccentric way of story telling.the flashfowards and twists and running gags were certainly one of the best parts. the acting is also really good,while i did feel the chemistry and character development is not as good as friends,the character of Neil Patrick Harris and cobie smulders were beautifully developed.the acting of Neil Patrick Harris and josh random is certainly the best in the show. overall,this is one show which started of as a friends wannabe ,but quickly establishes its own brilliance.\n",
      "0 \t\t How i met your mother is just a poor copycat of friends, and seriously if i were the show's creator i'd be ashamed of it..(it aired just a year after friends ended..) and the actors don't even come close to being funny as those in friends..this only proves how people will watch any crap that is on TV.. they should at least have the decency of changing the story a little...but nooo..\"last do the same things they did and also have the same characters-the joey type, the rachel type, ross's type ..\". have people didn't hated this show more for being just a blatant replica of friends.. also i don't understand how this crap have an 8.1 grade..it just unnerves me.. nobody in this show is funny and i'm not overreacting\n",
      "1 \t\t the show is really good. the characters are apt. its really fun to watch it. but i wish that it shouldn't come to a level below the expectations. and Neil Patrick aka barney , you are the best. the way barney takes the story along with Ted is awesome. call it legend...wait for it...dary. ;) the way barney accepts the challenge is really awesome. Lilly is always cute and foolish at times. marshal is like hopeless , brainless ,caring ,friendly. robin is hot , clever , bold ,a lovable slut at times ;). Ted is the hero...so hes charming , funny ,romantic ,foolish, caring etc finally \"the mother\" , u r still a wonderful mystery which is taking our breath off !!! Ted ,barney , marshal, robin, lily and the mother....we all love u guys :) !!!\n",
      "1 \t\t i really loved the story and the characters. it was so strong for most episodes except the last one. the only thing that left me heartbroken was that some characters were sacrificed for Ted. Guess they just wanted to finish it somehow and they come up with that \"Ending\". it could have been different and most fans could have been satisfied.\n",
      "1 \t\t Woke be damned! I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!My go to reruns whenever I need uplifting. PERFECT CAST!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜Perfect show!A lot to f Fun!A lot of laughs!\n",
      "1 \t\t My entire family loves this show. My only concern is that I can't stand the idea of spending 5 or so seasons trying to figure out who mom is. I could see us finding out who mom is at the end of this season and then renaming the show to \"How I fell in love with your mother.\" I could see after a season of that \"How I broke up with your mother.\" Then maybe a season \"How I realized your mother was the one.\"Then, \"How I got your mom to marry me.\" Then, maybe, \"Newly married life with your mother.\"The idea of renaming the show with the same underlying theme would be highly unique but keep the story line fresh. There are only so many years one can wait to find out who mom really is.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show was at its peak in the first couple of seasons and managed to be entertaining for a long time. It's witty, fun and heart warming.The last two seasons especially though are horrible. They're unfun scream fests that rely on drama that isn't very well executed and forget the show's comedic roots. My fiance and I managed to push our way through to the end, but in hindsight stopping after season 6 would have been the far better choice.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've seen every single season just finished catching up on the most recent season and i have to say i love and hate this show I'll start off with why i dislike it so the story is ted is telling the story of how he met his kids mother he go's on and on about ex after ex the whole time I'm left wondering why the hell he is telling his kids all this? it's been 7 seasons already currently on 8 and they still haven't told you who the mother is it seems like they are just stringing people along with that one concept I'm starting to get sick of it the show should have been called Ted's life story on another note heres why i liked the show All of the characters are funny and full of misadventures you've got the highschool sweethearts, the hopeless romantic, the player, and the career driven crazy party girl some of the side story's are put together really well and good for a laugh or two all and all its a good show but if they don't say who the mother is by the end of the season i will not be watching it anymore because i don't want another \"my name is earl\" to happen meaning getting cancelled without telling you rhe answer\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of my all time favorite television shows, and I think they did a phenomenal job from beginning to end in ever aspect of the show. It's much watch t.v., and I am thinking about watching it again... for the third time.\n",
      "0 \t\t Why every episode robin have sex with another character ?\n",
      "Last episode is a huge disappointment. It could be much more better\n",
      "1 \t\t The How I met Your Mother (HIMYM) franchise was an immensely entertaining series with a fantastic balance between comedy and drama that just nailed it! It was a show that I was comfortably capable of watching from start to finish with minor complaint and much enjoyment! Although the story of a lonesome protagonist seeking his 'one true love' in the streets of NYC is a tad trite, the manner in which the plot is delivered and narrated is just unfathomably unique and endearing.Like all TV series however, HIMYM had its ups and downs. At times it came across as a bit contrived and reckless with its story line. The twists and turns can be very gripping but sometimes I felt it was taking away from its overall sense of coherence and credibility. While the procrastinated revelation of the mother was frustrating, the intervening stories and the build up to the penultimate moment were greatly compelling. As for the main characters (along with the lesser ones), they were profoundly lovable, witty and insightful with some remarkably moving moments. And for that I say (to be read in that warm, appealing Bob Saget tone of voice) - kids, this is a series worth watching.\n",
      "1 \t\t After season 5 I started to dislike the show but I feel very sad in the end. I was always rooting for Ted and Robin. Sometimes the writers look derailed but they covered in the last episode. Tracy was very good and I really loved her acting. She should have been in the show from the start.\n",
      "Now from character to character:\n",
      "Barney: funniest one. But I did not like him with Robin.\n",
      "Robin: She was not that funny but her acting was good. She should have been known her feeling for Ted long back.\n",
      "Marshall and Lily: I loved their acting and were truly a perfect Jodi.\n",
      "Tracy: She was in the last season still amaze me.\n",
      "0 \t\t Maybe I would sound bad but this drama is one of the most overrated, illogical, pathetic and occasionally boring drama. Friendship is a novel thing but in the name of friendship, they showed us slutty and thoughtless persons who mostly defined as a benefactor of each other. Ted a total idiot fall in love within a second. Barney a womanizer but most funny among all character. Marshall and Lilly is a sweet couple. Robin, the most overrated boring character which lacks dignity.\n",
      "1 \t\t *ignoring the finale*\n",
      "Absolutely one of my favourite shows to binge watch\n",
      "0 \t\t I totally understand that some people don't like this type of show. It's rather shallow and to some people, not funny and boring, as the jokes are predictable and the characters don't grow. I, on the other hand, find it hilarious. Sure, maybe a majority of the jokes are predictable, but that doesn't take away the humor, at least not for me. The shows I usually watch are rather deep, and it's nice to watch something a bit more light, for lack of a better word.The show is rather inappropriate at times, especially with Barney, and I understand how people wouldn't want to watch that or wouldn't want their kids to watch it. Also, there are times when the show is rather discriminatory, for example, saying all girls are dumb and the only important thing about them is their bust, and I understand how people might be offended by that. However, I think that's part of what makes the show humorous. I am a girl, and I know that women aren't just there for their bust.I know that some people really dislike Ted. Sure, he seems like a jerk sometimes, but I think it's just part of his journey that will end in him meeting the kids' mother. Marshall and Lily are the sweetest couple. Their personalities compliment each other really well, and I just love them. Barney is by far the funniest character, in my opinion. The things he does to pick up women are just hilarious, such as the time he said he was from the future and that a girl had to sleep with the past him so he could save the planet. I thought that was one of the most creative ways to pick up a girl. Obviously, most girls aren't that stupid, but it's still funny. Robin is probably my favorite character. She's pretty, but isn't portrayed as stupid. Plus, she's able to bring out the romanticism in Barney, which no other main character was able to do. Also, I sort of connect to her, both of us a bit afraid of commitment.How I Met Your Mother is the first and only American sitcom I have watched, as I find them, in general, lame and boring. However, HIMYM just pulls me in.\n",
      "1 \t\t Love this show, There is many scenes and moments in this show that have made me laugh a lot the first time i saw it! And it also got a few musical moments as well witch is great! Highly Recommend.\n",
      "1 \t\t I throughly enjoy sit-coms and this is in my top 3! Hilarious and just great, but if I'm honest I hated the last episode. It should have stayed with everyone happy together. Barney and Robin should never have gotten a divorce, the mother never should have died and Ted never should have gotten with Robin. I waited all this time throughout nine whole seasons for it to end like that.\n",
      "0 \t\t Loved the show but hated the ending. Big disappointment.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show has good premise and I really liked the first two seasons, but then something got really wrong.The jokes are repetitive and the funny lines are becoming annoying. I know that this is an attempt to show the continuity in the characters, but it's not funny anymore. See, if 'Suit Up' was fun at first (for me, even the first time it wasn't, but on that later) after 10 times it's just getting old.The second problem I have with this series is that deliberately bash at the main character. See, all other characters (supposedly his best friends, but I kinda doubt this, because with friends like these ...) constantly show how boring, whiny and idiotic is the main character. I've never found this fascinating or funny. And of course how are we expected to like Ted after that? The next problem I have is that to me Barney is too overrated (yes too is for reason here). The actor tries too hard to play the ultimate playboy (how he is beyond my mind, because his pickup lines are ridiculous and most of the women wouldn't buy this) and fails hard for me. In fact his character is used to mock at the female population, which annoys me a little. Not to mention the fact that him repeating how awesome he is, is not making him awesome. It makes him more annoying. The audience should decide if he's awesome, not the character himself.There are also good points. The flashbacks from the college are interesting. The narrator is not that bad either. The whole idea for searching clues for the mother is OK, but 7 seasons is just getting boring. I like mystery stories, but the well balanced ones, where every few episodes something is revealed and not 23 episodes season with 22 fillers.To sum up - if you're looking for some good portion of laugh, then you can watch the first two seasons - they are kinda funny. If you are looking for meaningful story with multidimensional characters that act logically and are changing for the better, than this story might not be that satisfying.\n",
      "1 \t\t To all the people who say the end is dissapointing let me tell you i don not agree , everything in this show is \"legend wait for it dary\" . One's path to their destiny is not straight it a curvy one and thats how the show moves it shows the reality of the story that get struck under load of creating happy ending thats is where this show outshines in a unique way.\n",
      "1 \t\t I started watching this show almost a year ago now and finished it a few days before it was removed from Netflix. I started watching it after a buddy of mine was shocked that I hadn't watched a single episode of it after talking about cinema and tv shows. So I watched the first episode, and I actually really liked it.A lot of people criticize the show for turning sour over time, but if anything I think the show was very consistent. It's roughly the same character tropes that come and go every episode of every season, with pretty much the same quality every time. Either you learn to love it, or you're probably going to find the entire series to be insufferably unfunny.One thing to keep in mind though is that the comedy is very mainstream and dorky in an American way. Sometimes it's just cringe. The words \"bro\", \"awesome\", and any other typical privileged middle aged American dude word you can come up with are constantly used in both charming and embarassing ways. There's also a lot of humor surrounding alcohol, but that's to be expected, and honestly a lot of the show's funniest moments come from that.Not all characters are that likeable and yet I ended up liking pretty much all of them in one way or another. The characters aren't always realistic, but it's important to remember that the narrator of the story is Ted Mosby so if something feels too exaggerated it's probably intentional. It's a pretty fun show that also offers weirdly insightful thoughts on love and romance, but I fully understand if it isn't for everybody.\n",
      "1 \t\t While never the most original or smartest show HIMYM was still very good in its glory days. However the final season threw it all away, especially with the horrendous finale which, while originally the plan at the beginning, was so obviously out of place character wise by the end of the show.\n",
      "1 \t\t You guys are my..... wait for it.... family! I love the characters and feel like I am related to them.... It makes me happy :)\n",
      "1 \t\t I only can say that I am in love with that TV show. I think that is the best and more funniest serial\n",
      "1 \t\t Stop! If you didn't watch all the seasons of the sitcom stop reading this review. Contains massive spoilers!Everyone is opposed to the end, but not everyone has understood one thing. This show has made it clear that the mother no longer lives today.\n",
      "To the end of the sitcom we have the episode when Ted was alone in the bar with the \"wrestlers vs machines\" ticket in front, and then he say what he would do if he knew what's next. So we have the next scene with Ted running to the mother of the kids and saying, with tears in his eyes, he would like to spend those 45 extra days, or at least 45 seconds with her.\n",
      "Then we have the scene where Tracy asks Ted \"What mother would miss her daughter's wedding?\" when suddenly Ted starts crying, knowing that Tracy is sick and will miss their daughter's wedding.\n",
      "In my opinion was a fitting end. Life is not always the way we want, we always know new people, we have new experiences, but we have to learn how to cherish every moment next to our friends and family.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great but not that great for 2020, it s clear that if this show would ve come out in this year, well, we all know. So many jokes about women and stereotypical men. And plus Ted is not that great, he doesn t give a f about friendship whatsoever. The ending, yeah =]]]\n",
      "1 \t\t This is by far the best show ever written. Ever single episode just gets funnier and funnier whilst still maintaining the mystery of who the \"mother\" is. I think it's quite hard to keep mystery with comedy but the writers of this show have not failed one bit. This show has been watched by millions and often more than once. I am currently on my 4th time rewatching this show and it never gets old!Barney Stinson is the funniest character but all of the characters are equally very well thought through. They all have an amazing journey though the years and i think it is very wonderful to watch.\n",
      "1 \t\t I am a 16 year Old Boy and In my opinion this series is one of the greatest TV-Series that has been ever made.... coordination of the main actors(Josh Radnor,Jason Segel,Cobie Smulders,Neil Patrick Harris,Alyson Hannigan)is one of the best things about this series. specially Neil Patrick Harris.he plays his character,the best way that is possible. also the Writers of this series have done A great job.The characters that they've made,completely fit to the actors. ____in each single episode,Happiness,sadness,friendship,loves,hates and great funny moments are gathered so they can create you an spectacular 20 minutes. ____ Many peoples say that this TV-series is so much alike The memorable TV- series of \"The Friends\".Also many people disagree. I Love them both.They make me laugh.They make me happy,and they both are wonderful. so my recommendation for the people that want to spend their time for a good TV-Series and have a great time,full of fun,is this great TV series.I hope that you find this review useful. Thanks.\n",
      "0 \t\t It is taking too long time to find out who the mother is. Boring. I know it is a comedy, but everyone want's to know who's the mother. I think the mother wasn't thought of in the beginning, she was thought of in the end.\n",
      "0 \t\t Has anyone else noticed that the sound is like the is an echo, or like they are in a cave? I have noticed over the last few weeks that it has not gotten any better. The show itself this year has been extremely bland and unfullfilling. I am hoping that it picks up in the weeks to come. However if the sound quality does not improve I may be inclined to watch another show. My husband dislikes the show. I personally like it but the sound this season is very annoying. I do wonder if the show will be on long enough to actually find out who there mother actually is. My husband has a hard time watching the show without making some sort of Doogie reference, it gets old, but I like my Barney.\n",
      "1 \t\t Since the end of Friends I did not think I could love a comedy that much but since a few months that I started watching HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER my thougths change and now i am in the 5 season and i cant believe how much i am enjoying this.I have just the problem of the censuring that future Ted uses with his kids.But putting aside that this is possibly the best series i have ever seen.It has everything a group of friends should have it has the married couple, the romantic, the Canadian/famous and the most important part of a group a Barney and his awesomeness.I just love all the stuff the series has to offer all of Barneys quotes \"suit-up\", \"legen- wait for -dary\" among others and probably he is the best of the group but without Ted,Lilly,Marshal and Robin this would best complete waste of time to watch but the combination of all of them is what makes this the best thing to watch when you are on any mood and you always laugh no matter how many times you watch it.If you haven't watch it you should at least give it a chance I can promise you wont regret it not even a second.Also if you have the possibility to watch from the first chapter i could increase by a million times how much you like because a side it always makes you laugh no mater if you have seen it or not it also has a very rich and original story that yo would love.Knowing this i hope you watch it and if you are already watching eat enjoyed at the most because how would you not.\n",
      "0 \t\t I personally really enjoy lengthy shows to binge and get very invested in. I enjoyed a lot of the show, so I will give it that. But there are some HUGE flaws that aren't something I can look past. First of all, the whole premise of the show is about who Ted Mosby ends up with. Ted is a character I find completely insufferable.. It's hard to be invested in someone who I literally wish wasn't even in the show. I feel it would have been a MUCH better show had it just followed Lily and Marshall's relationship and had Barney and Robin as their friends that end up together and they split their friendship off at the end as they grow into their own lives. I would have easily given the show 9 or 10 stars if that was the case. But that wasn't the case, and the ending was also predictable and unpredictable in the worst ways. They tried to push us so hard to not like Robin and Barney together and do like Ted and Robin together and at the end of episodes I would be ranting that they better not end up together in the end of the show because it was literally the worst possible outcome... surprise, there IS a worse outcome. The mother we've been building up to this whole time is briefly introduced and killed off immediately because her only purpose was to have these kids he's telling this story to so he can go be with Robin. Because the \"only\" reason they weren't together besides the zero chemistry and being complete opposites on very important things, was because she didn't want kids. So he went and had his kids with this poor filler lady and then gets back together with Robin in the end? Spare me. I love this show, but I hate it so much.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I first saw the ads for this show, I wasn't interested. And I'm a big Alyson Hannigan fan. It just looked like something that couldn't be carried very far.Boy, was I wrong.This show is one of the best comedies on television. The fact that it airs right before Two and a Half Men makes CBS the place to be on Monday nights. I just wish people would stop comparing this show to Friends. How I Met Your Mother is SO much better! Barney (played by Doogie Howser... uh, I mean, Neil Patrick Harris)is definitely the funniest one on the show. He's the scheming, goof ball, idiot with the hare-brained schemes, all the cheesy lines, and he pulls it off perfectly. However, all the rest of the cast pulls their weight as well.In short, give this a watch. It's not Friends. But it's much better.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show, it is everything you want from a comedy. It's smart, witty and very very funny. The characters are very well developed throughout the season and you find yourself rooting more and more for these people. I watched this show 3 times from A to Z and if i would watch a fourth time, it will still crack me up big time. What i love most about this show that is explains everything, you will see the aftermath of everything, a lot of shows should take example to this. but most just let you hanging and things don't get a rightful explanation. WE NEED THIS! because it makes us relate to a character more if we see how they deal with their problems instead of just \"POOF\" problem gone, but no one knows how.The running jokes trough the seasons are also very funny! -Slap bet -Mashall and Lilly's bets -Robin SparklesEveryone who is a fan of comedy should definitely watch this show.\n",
      "0 \t\t Worst show ever with the most absurd ending and torturous final season.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother was my 2nd sitcom after Friends. I think this sitcom is as funny as Friends and it is funny but not compare to friends. The whole sitcom run around Ted Mosby An architect who wants to met his wife and serious Relationship and his friends. I think most of viewers Disappointed with Finale because Total Season 9 is about the wedding of Barney and Robin and shot Cameos of The mother. If you want to watch How i met your mother then you can watch but till season 8. Season 9 is also funny but Season 9 is not worth to watch. AND SERIOUSLY THEY RUIN SEASON 9.\n",
      "1 \t\t In the first season of HIMYM, I wrote a review after finding the show intolerable after a few episodes. I didn't watch for years and the show kept going... after seeing some excerpts from the following seasons, I recognized the show did begin to live up to (what I saw as) its original potential.It truly became great. I am keeping the original review here, so you can see my criticisms and understand that the show grew and truly overcame them all. Over years it became brilliant. My wife and I picked it up around season 4 and watched all the prior seasons that summer, then faithfully stuck with it until the end (even when they aggravatingly created what felt like a couple of filler seasons (7 and 8) to keep milking the cash cow. When it ended, we brought my teenage kids in and watched it all again.The thing about this show is, it's well suited to binge watching, from a time before binge watching was a thing. The occasionally clunky episode is quickly forgotten as you carry on to the next. Even the weaker seasons have both touching and hilarious moments. The much-maligned ending of the show is, from my perspective, absolutely in keeping with how the show evolved and was a very realistic and appropriate finalé.Watch it. Push through the rough parts and you'll find it's a gem. Neil Patrick Harris is fantastic and every cast member is great, whether transient or permanent.I hated the show in the beginning, but now I have to say it's one of my all-time favourites. Watch it, enjoy it and I hope you love it as much as we did.-----Original Review Below-----------------------------------\n",
      "What can I say? I watched all the publicity all summer about this show while watching lamearse \"Big Brother\" on CBS and really thought I liked the idea of how this show was going to work. I pictured a sort of \"Mad About You\" type thing with a more expansive feel - the early days of meeting and dating evolving into what would become a long term relationship. What a tremendous premise if it was done in a \"looking back\" way. I even thought it might be something like a look-back-to-the-80s sort of thing although that wasn't really clear at all in the previews.When I started watching the first episode and I saw the \"Wonder Years\" type narrative form, I thought, hey, this could be actually a really great concept... borrowing from others but making a completely new form. 2030? OK, so the setting will be more present day - I can live with that.Then, I watched the show. And then the second episode. And the third.How disappointing.The concept should have led to a really original idea. The cast have that familiarity born of folks who have been around TV in somewhat different roles but they should be believable in these ones. I admit it - I LIKE Neil Patrick Harris and Alyson Hannigan in this. Or at least, I SHOULD like them if they were actually given some material to work with. I guess the expression I am looking for is - I WANT to like them, they are working so hard.What's wrong with the show? Well, after you get past the premise - almost everything. I don't think you can blame the cast - it is like they have been handed an armload of coal and asked to make diamonds. There just is not enough substance or originality in the writing. The jokes are various combinations of old, predictable and lame. All the spark and humour that made classics like \"Night Court\", \"Cheers\" and \"Seinfeld\" work is completely absent. There is also no trace of farcical or out-there innuendo that made shows like \"Three's Company\" and \"Mork and Mindy\" hilarious.I remember in the \"golden era\" of the sitcom, sometimes sitting in front of my television with my ribs aching from laughing so hard. This show should have been the kind of thing that I would find somewhat hilarious. Many of the \"old classic\" shows have found new life in recent years by revisiting the concepts originally envisioned and updating them - for example, Battlestar Galactica. Others have touched me in different ways I have I aged and my life has evolved. Since I now have kids of my own, I often enjoy stories based on premises like \"how we met\" or \"how we started a family\" - I guess age, experience and wisdom allow me to relate well. I enjoyed \"Six Feet Under\" not only because of the interesting concept and brilliant writing, but because it kept me grounded in a way by reminding me to live life to its fullest because everyone is going to die.Why am I bringing all this up? Because I think this show has, or maybe just HAD, great potential. Strong writing and a dedicated network could have turned this into the next long-running television classic sitcom in spite of this era of \"reality\" television and the proliferation of copycat special-FX driven crime dramas. Instead, it is just a pale imitation of the far overrated Friends wrapped in a \"Wonder Years\" wrapper. (Don't get me wrong, I liked Friends, but it was only really funny for a couple of seasons - I didn't LOVE it like some other sitcoms.) I'm going to try watching a little more. Heck, I gave \"Joey\" 4 months before I gave up on it. My advice to others would be to check it out, but don't expect too much.You'll likely be just as disappointed as I was.\n",
      "1 \t\t I got the chance to watch reruns in order on DVR, so I saw all of the episodes in a short time, since I was hooked! This gave me the chance to witness something that knocked me off my feet. A lot of shows will have so many inconsistencies. Not 'How I met your mother'. They go back often to previous clips, and reference things that have come up in the past. I have never noticed an inconsistancy, and remember clearly since the shows I watched were recent.Almost every episode makes me laugh at least a few times, but some are literally epic, amazing works of t.v. writing genius. Not very many shows can accomplish this level of insight in 20 minutes and make it funny. I liken a lot of the jokes to seinfeld, as they take parts of life that people don't notice much, and turn the situations into absolute hilarity. One of my favorites is when Ted is dating a woman who talks too much, but he doesn't notice cause he likes her. When they finally tell him, he hears literal glass shattering as his perceptions are changed and he now can't ignore it. Funny in itself, but then the friends go through cycles of \"shattering illusions\" for everyone else in the group that goes through a chain of hilarity as they're all suddenly so annoyed by one another. I couldn't believe the depth of that episode for a silly comedy, and I laugh so hard, so often from this show. It belongs in a bracket all it's own. Great job, writers\n",
      "0 \t\t OK,so the first 8 episodes of this season sucked but the last two episodes were really good.I still find people complaining about how bad the show has become and how funny it used to be 6 years ago,even though half of them have never actually watched the show.Yes,using the whole wedding as a theme for the last season may not seem appealing,but every plot twist in How I Met Your Mother was made for a reason(remember the time when Barney proposed to Robin?). Of course this season isn't the best of the series,but you can't deny the fact that the mother is making more occasional visits and that the Lily and Marshall plot is going to be exciting,now that she knows he accepted the job offer. All I'm asking you folks is to give the show some time,and instead of complaining about it actually WATCH the show(seriously,is 22 minutes out of 7 days in a week too much to ask?)\n",
      "0 \t\t It was going so well at the end of the episode 22. But then episode 23 and 24 ruin everything! At least for me. For me that was not a happy ending. Specially with Ted and Barney. A happy ending is when Ted don't lose his wife and even if he does, he cannot end up with Robin. I mean, that's the one of the main plot of this series. It is a never ending journey between Robin and Ted, but at the end Ted will always lose Robin. So by giving Robin to Ted, it takes out the only original idea of this series. And then there's Barney: taking Robin away from him was already bad enough but telling me that a kid (a \"thing\" that Barney always hated) will change his playboy nature?! That is just...crap. A total disappointing ending. My rating went from 9 to 1 in just 46 minutes. It was so bad, so stupid that, at one moment, I thought it was an April Fools joke. But maybe there will be some people who will like this ending. Some people who will love seeing Ted and Robin together. Who knows... But for me, the ending was just awful!\n",
      "1 \t\t Was not very hot on watching the first few episodes of the first season, but my girlfriend at the time insisted, so I kept on... Halfway through the 1st season I was absolutely hooked! The concept is kind of similar to 'Friends' but the character development and the plot are distinctly different. Then again, 'Friends' was a hit in the 90s and this is a more modern sitcom set in the 00's. Now don't get me wrong, I am not suggesting that 'Friends' is not withstanding the test of time as a comedy. 'How I met you Mother' delivers a fresher and different look at social group dynamics which manages to be hilariously funny at times. When compared to the fits of laughter I had watching 'Friends' at the time its seems a bit lukewarm, a bit cutesy if you know what I mean.I would like point out that in 'How I met you Mother' the Barney character is for me the source of most of its best funny moments ! I find the rest of the characters simply not equally funny (to say the least) and I guess that is what makes me consider 'How I met you Mother' as lukewarm compared to 'Friends' where all the characters had their fair share! All in all 'How I met you Mother' is a very good attempt at sitcom and I would definitely recommend it!\n",
      "1 \t\t This sitcom is now one of my favorites, hand in hand with FRIENDS. I really love its humor, its bizarre adventures, its love stories, its flashbacks and forwards. What I love the most: its CATCHPHRASESIf you're thinking about watching this fantastic comedy series, you certainly HAVE TO. It's AWESOME (as Barney Stinson would say). Of all, I think that what makes it special is the chemistry between the actors. The five of them get on very well, they seem to enjoy so much working together. That is one of the most important things to have success, because they transmit the message exactly the way they feel, and if they feel comfortable, it shows. Sadly, it ends tomorrow, which makes me a little blue, I will miss them so much. But what I can tell you is that the story line is NOT boring at all. It keeps you entertained, even when you're pulling your hair out because you want to know the answer to the show: How did he met the mother? So, don't panic, enjoy while you watch the nine seasons, because it's an incredible experience. You feel you grow as the characters do, you understand them, you will LOVE them. I highly recommend this wonderful creation!!! EXCELLENT!\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is simply put weaker version of Friends. It has a lot of similarities but generally the jokes and scenes are very forgettable and not so good.\n",

      "1 \t\t Together with Seinfeld and Friends the best sit-com! For 8 season anyway, unfortunately they drop the ball the last season, but still epic..\n",
      "1 \t\t I have a soft spot in my heart for all of the sitcoms I watched in my early teenage years, HIMYM is one of them, but it's quality is so great that it doesn't need to rely on nostalgic appeal to turn anyone into a fan.With good written jokes and truly dramatic moments, great performances and dynamics, and overall freshness and style, HIMYM is the whole package when it comes to sitcoms.Despite the mediocre ninth season and the anticlimactic finale - and all the hate that both of them caused in the audience, and also downgraded my final score from 8/10 to 7/10 - I recommend you give this series a try.\n",
      "1 \t\t Everything in it is very, very legendary, the best series in history .Legendary\n",
      "1 \t\t I know it's too late to review this show, but the comedy channel has been showing reruns of both Friends and HIMYM, and it got me thinking, how on earth are people saying that Friends is far better. Agreed the premises is similar, friends hanging together, but HIMYM is far more superior and mature. And the characters are much well writ and much more developed than Friends.\n",
      "First of all we have Lily and Marshell, their love is a showcase in endurance and maturity. I love them together as a couple and I love each one of them. Lily (Lilypad) is the mature voice or reason of the group, but she's also has a dark side, a devious mind and a scheming nature. Marshell (or Marshemellow) is the Ted advocate, but he is also the person who wants to prove that people can be nice and sweet, and he sets out to prove it whether as a lawyer or a judge, a husband and later on as a father.\n",
      "Robin and Barney, Robin is the strong independent woman, no one can say who's your daddy to Robin Sherbatsky... but there is another naughty side to her as Sparkles. Barney (the Barnicle) is just Legen I hope you're not lactose intolerant because the second part of this word is dary, he is legendary. NPH did a great job of portraying Barney, and in my opinion, he has the most developed character arch in the entire group. We first meet him as a devil may care playboy, but with glimpses of his own true loving nature that is buried deep down, his love to Robin helped bring him the peace that he was looking for and they are so fit together, it is like he said, deep down he felt kind of broken and Robin helped take away this feeling. For me, they never broke up.\n",
      "Ted (Teddy Westside), is super cute and adorable, he is the dreamer of the group, the one who believes in love, the consummate romantic, and they got him a super cute and lovable mother to complete him. In my mind, she never passed away and they are still living together happily ever after.\n",
      "I know that is nothing like real life, but I am not looking for real life in a sitcom, I'm looking for laughter, hope and romance.\n",
      "I also loved that their significant others got to do parts in the show, I particularly loved Scooter and Sandy Rivers.\n",
      "The guest stars were also great, I loved the episode with Jennifer Lopez and the one with Ralph Macchio, his personification of Barney was incre I hope you're hungry because the second part of this word is edible, it was incredible.\n",

      "1 \t\t When I saw the previews of this show last year, I was very impatient to discover it. I've recently been able to watch the first season and I haven't been disappointed. The show's been compared to \"Friends\", some have said it was not as funny, etc...But it can't really be compared to Friends. There's stuff in common of course, young people in NY, with love issues, roommates, and a place to drink. And that's it. The characters don't just drink coffee and tea. They mostly drink beer and vodka-cranberry, like real people. That's the key point about the characters. They're real. Which is why I think people like them. We've all been a Ted, for the most romantic, with a Robin. And we all know that perfect couple, like the one formed by Lily and Marshall. And we also all know a Barney, with different levels of craziness. So, the show is funny, but also romantic, and touching, and pretty realistic, and that's why it's a good and also original show. Last but not least, the actors are excellent.\n",
      "0 \t\t This show is near perfect for me. The characters are well written. The show gives us little side stories to get to know the characters more deeply but one character that we don't get to know better is the mother. The one we are seeking to know for 8 seasons. Tracy definetly needed more screen time. And the laugh tracks... I don't know if it's just me but it's kinda annoying to hear them..\n",
      "1 \t\t It was funny at first but the show was gradually changing for COMEDY TO ROMANCE DRAMA.......... those claiming that HIMYM it's the best comedy show don't realize it but they just fell in for the drama. It wasn't really a comedy show anymore.\n",
      "1 \t\t Nice show, you should check it out if you have the chance. It's sort of like Friends, as it is the story of 5 single twenty-something friends and their relationships. If you were a fan of Friends, I think you would like this show.Neil Patrick Harris is great as the smooth talking womanizer Barney and newcomer Cobie Smulders is just beautiful as Robin. Alyson Hannigan provides some slapstick. Josh Radnor, the slightly paranoid romantically struggling Ted begins each episode telling his bored kids the story of \"how\" he met their mother. As Harris (Barney) says, suit up and check out this show!CBS recently moved this show to Mondays at 8pm, it had been on at 8:30. It's part of a great lineup on Monday night sitcoms.\n",
      "1 \t\t Taken on an amazing journey from start to finish. The character development from the first to last episode is brilliant and you come to love all of them.Fantastically funny with plenty of heart and emotion as well. The sad times are handled just as well as the comedy.MUST WATCH!\n",

Rest of the cast is attractive smart & quick. Though I think the writing goes for the obvious occasionally, it has a heart beneath the cleverness & pokes fun at itself too.I am back to Prison Break for the new season. BUT soon as I can, I'll be checking in on these kids.\n",

I love the casts, the stories, how they put the continuity on every episodes, man I just love the show. I love Barney, I love Neil Patrick Harris, too. This man is bought the womanizer's character. Then we got Lily with her sweet-naughty's girl things, then Ted with his anxious-sweet lover's things, Robin with her independent-strongly attractive's things, and of course Marshall with his good-guy-Minnesota's thing. beside the series, I also watched their bloopers on YouTube. Man, makes me wanted to be the part of the set! Overall, with consciousness, I recommend you - nay, I insist you to watch all of the HIMYM series. And p.s., I wrote this #imho, so... No arguments needed. Enjoy!! :))\n",
      "1 \t\t This series does answer a lot of questions and let you never lose hope.\n",

      "Some great running jokes, some minor inconsistencies.The mother came in too late and was gone too fast. But then again, it was \"how i MET your mother\".It holds up for 2020.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is my favorite comedy sitcom of all time. Its is absolutely hilarious but also has the whole love story and direction, which some sitcoms don't have, as everything builds up to the the simple fact of how Ted met his wife. Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel are just fantastic in this show. Both have perfect comedic timing and presence. But they are not the only ones as Radnor, Smulders, and Hannigan also have amazing presence with in the cast. I have followed this show from the very beginning of it and it has not lost any of what makes it special, even after have watching every episode on DVD probably about 50 times. I have also shown this show to all my friends and every single one who I showed got hooked on the show and loved it so if you have not seen it you need to go pick it up right now.\n",
      "1 \t\t I am one of those people who likes to give a show time, and thats what i did with this show.It starts off quite good but nothing special but its worth staying with as seasons 3,4 and 5 are very entertaining (mainly thanks to Barney). However after these seasons I would say I became a fan and had to watch it every week as soon as it came out in the US, however recently it has really dipped and the writers seem to be lacking creativity. Its became a chore to watch and i feel i'm only watching it because i have to.So overall I'd give it a 7/10 purely down to the respect i have for the peak in the middle.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show has been more or less consistent since it first aired. It has good writing, a good cast with good chemistry, and they know how to keep things fresh and when a joke has been overdone. NPH is amazing in the show, but the other members have enough moments so that he doesn't stand out as a singularity for the quality of the show. It has been going a bit downhill this season, but the way the latest episodes are playing out I'm confident there will be more great ones to come.The show has set up quite a legacy for itself, and I look forward to seeing what they come up with in the future.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a situation comedy about the main character, Ted, who is telling a story to his children about how he meets their mother. It has five main characters and tells their stories, with a special focus on Ted. The characters are young adults, and Ted is a hopeless romantic around whom the story centers. The show communicates the importance of friendship and proclaims the value of storytelling, especially down through the generations. Its setting is New York in the 2000s, in the context of storytelling of father to children about young adulthood and the quest for his wife. The topic is greatly about romance, with a good deal also about destiny because Ted is very committed to the idea of destiny and struggles with feeling like he is losing his destiny. Friendship is also very important in the show. The author is a team of writers, led by Carter Bays. The intended audience is American. The show can be enjoyed by all ages, but is mainly geared towards teenagers and people in their twenties. The purpose of the program is to show the importance of storytelling and to encourage hope in the existence of a soul mate and a destiny for one's life.Since the invention of television, the genre of situation comedies has captured the imaginations of American viewers. The content of situation comedies tends to focus on the relationships among the characters. In recent times, this often means a show about a group of friends who live together and spend a lot of time together at the same places. How I Met Your Mother is one of these shows. The group of friends often includes certain roles: a \"player\" character (in this case, Barney Stinson), a stable couple (Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin), a more desirable female character (Robin Scherbatsky), and a protagonist with whom the audience is meant to identify (Ted Mosby). How I Met Your Mother features three types of characters - main, supporting, and transient. The audience is meant to relate primarily to and watch closely the five main characters.The rhetorical strategy of How I Met Your Mother is that the story is told through emotional responses to situations on the part of Ted and the rest of the characters. In the various episodes, the emotions are seen to be trustworthy guides for life. This includes the emotions of the audience, engaged through a \"heart strings\" strategy of storytelling, which is intended to make the audience become emotionally invested in the story. The format of How I Met Your Mother usually unfolds in an episode when during the time in which the characters are hanging out, there is a problem to be solved. The problem is usually solved through the relationships among the group, conveying the message that relationships are important. The syntax, diction, and visual appeal of How I Met Your Mother tends to be very informal and familiar, with the use of much slang language and a setting that is often in intimate spaces, which creates a sense of intimacy and \"being on the inside\" of the lives of the characters. The show depicts the group's relationships, using emotional appeals to the audience and depicting the everyday lives of Ted and his friend in a way that creates intimacy with the audience. This intimacy is reinforced by the use of informal syntax, diction, and visual appeal. The aim of this show is to entertain the audience by making the audience feel connected to the characters from the inside of the story.In How I Met Your Mother, the audience knows that everything is going to be okay, that the ending is going to be happy. This expectation is contained in the very name of its genre as a situation comedy because \"comedy\" in classical drama is a story with a happy ending that deals with light and humorous events. The audience is not expecting a heavy story when watching How I Met Your Mother. In fact, the audience is looking for intimacy with the characters, searching to be friends with them. This means that the audience is prepared to identify with the characters in their belief that love is important and happiness is worth pursuing. How I Met Your Mother tells a story that is for everyone, but it focuses on the lives of young adults. This does not mean that the intimacy with the characters is only available to young adults; older viewers can be reflecting back on that time in their lives, and younger viewers can be looking forward to that time in their lives. The story takes place within American culture, even if it is appreciated by people from other cultures. The poor and super-rich seem to be excluded in the storytelling, and the story depicts the lives of white Americans living in New York City, especially the upper west side of Manhattan. It may be the case that there would be less appeal towards intimacy with the characters of the show for those who do not fit into the category of upper-middle-class white Americans living on the coasts of the United States.How I Met Your Mother assumes many values that it takes for granted. Firstly, the show assumes that emotions are reliable guides for the pursuit of happiness. It also assumes that love is worth pursuing and that friendship is the central good of life. There is not much religion depicted in the show, which implies the value assumption that religion is not that important. Parents do play a role in the story, but they are not central to the action. The value assumption of that aspect of the genre seems to be that problems are best worked out with peers and not intergenerationally. There is also the value assumption that jobs are important; the show tells stories in the office setting, and career is presented as a big part of who someone is. All in all, intimacy between audience and characters is created in the context of the pursuit of happiness and investment in relationships and career.The storytelling strategy of How I Met Your Mother is effective because the viewer is invited to live day-to-day life with the characters, getting to see why friendship is important because we see the characters living it out. The \"heart strings\"strategy works because it causes the viewer to be emotionally invested in the story, making the story personal. Both of these strategies are effective in creating intimacy between the characters and audience members who can relate to them and are emotionally invested in them. For example, we learn a lot about Marshall's relationship with his father. Therefore, when we learn about Marshall's father passing, the audience is deeply affected. Someone who has had a similar experience with a parent passing might relate and feel more emotions during that episode. Of course, the power of the \"heart strings\" method is limited by the degree to which the audience can identify with the characters. It is doubtful that the son of Vietnamese immigrants in Galveston, Texas, is going to relate as strongly to these situation comedies as a white American young adult living in New York or Los Angeles.The storytelling of How I Met Your Mother does not have the same \"self help\" effect on an audience as a TED Talk or some other inspirational material. Rather, it has the effect of comfort on the audience, making the audience feel connected to the characters in an emotional way. A young, middle-school girl, for example, could be experiencing significant fears around the prospect of growing up, and she could receive a good deal of comfort from watching Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin, and Barney going through young adulthood and surviving and even thriving. This makes that time in one's life feel less scary and creates a deep sense of connection with the show and its characters. How I Met Your Mother shows life's ups and downs, which helps the audience have a more realistic approach to their own lives. Ted, our main character, often experiences failure. This shows the audience that it is normal to face difficulties in life and that no one is perfect. In other words, How I Met Your Mother does not produce the same kind of depression that some forms of social media can cause. The show is more real, and therefore more attractive, than social media. The realism of the action creates intimacy because it is easier to connect with something realistic. No one is feeling intimacy with SpongeBob, even if they enjoy the show, because we are not sponges living at the bottom of the ocean. Seeing Ted get heartbroken by a breakup, on the other hand, helps the audience process their own difficult emotions and makes them feel an intimate tie with Ted and his friends.How I Met Your Mother invites audiences to enter into the everyday lives of characters by using the \"heart strings\" connection with the audience and inviting the audience into intimate moments of characters' lives. Informal and familiar syntax, diction, and visual appeal helps the audience feel like they are living along with the characters. The aim of the show is to provide lighthearted entertainment to the audience, while making the audience feel intimacy with the characters from the inside of the story. How I Met Your Mother thrives on the power of making accurate observations about life. Sometimes those observations are unrealistic, or at least unrelatable, to audience members who are not upper-middle-class white American young adults living on the coasts. However, most of the time How I Met Your Mother depicts life in an emotionally-balanced way, even dealing at times with serious issues in the context of a lighthearted friendship. At its best, the show allows audience members to process fears and difficulties in life, reassuring the audience that even when life feels like a tragedy, it is ultimately a comedy.\n",
      "1 \t\t this is the first TV show that i started watching when i started my college. this was 5 years ago - during these years many other shows - good shows - have come and gone by but none of them , none of them matches the originality and authenticity of this show. the characters are very very deep and u fall in love with them - never during its run has it bored me even a slightest bit. i don't know how to express myself - it was the last episode today and this is the first time i am actually reviewing some season/movie . i am actually said that this is over but nevertheless it was a great run. I URGE EVERYONE WHO LIKES STORY , ROMANCE PLUS TRUE COMEDY TO PLEASE WATCH THIS SHOW. YOUR TIME WONT BE WASTED bubye how i met your mother i shall miss ted the most\n",
      "0 \t\t I remember when i used to look forward to episodes of this show. Now it's gone down the drain big time. The beginning of the current season started out on a bad foot with the whole Ted/Victoria stuff that we all KNEW wasn't going to work out yet they did it anyway. Now they're doing this Barney/Robin stuff. Honestly, no more dancing on tiptoes around each other it's become unbearable. I turned off an episode halfway through the other day and i'm glad i did. I can't stand the new episodes anymore. It's like the writers don't care anymore, they've made Ted out to be such a wuss more so then previous seasons. Too many LeBron/Cleveland jokes. Honestly Cleveland and Cavs have moved on from that more then the writers.\n",
      "1 \t\t The lives, loves and laughs of 5 Manhattanites... sound familiar? Well it should. But this is a far cleverer and more textured show than Friends. Its controversial ending aside, How I Met Your Mother is a brilliant show. Funny, off-beat, irreverent, dramatic, deftly written and wonderfully acted, this is a hilarious, poignant and often touching show. A highlight of mid-00s sitcoms, and a wonderful offering in the Golden Age of American comedy shows. Highly recommended.\n",
      "0 \t\t When I first started watching this show I was actually pretty pleased with the content of the show. It had a lot of good things going for them. They have a cool, completely original premise. They have a pretty good cast, I only started watching for Hannigan (loved her in Buffy). Neil Patrick Harris and the guy who plays MArshall basically save this show from sucking, they are amazing in their respective roles and provide most of the comedy punch. However now in the second season it is pretty apparent that this show is gonna be nothing more than a slightly above average sitcom. This show is only OK, the writing is not that great and in sitcoms it really is all about the writing of the show, and some acting which the cast does a good job with.This show is gonna have a long run only because it is pretty generic and is therefore marketable to the mainstream public. I think if they really wanted to take a chance with this show it would really really work. They have the tools to make this a better show.\n",
      "1 \t\t I had started watching \"How I met your mother\" by the time I finished watching \"Friends\". I was so into Friends at that time, and couldn't accept the idea of watching another sitcom. Well, at least at the very first. Only a few episodes through the first season, I was totally intrigued. The show is a masterpiece. It has every element a comedy sitcom would need to have. It teaches you the true meaning of friendship and love at times. The gang's amazing friendship is what we all dream of having. Moreover, having Barney Stinson \"Neil Patrick Harris\" added so much to this show. Even though, some people hated his character for the terrible things he does to women, it's a comedy show after all, and he nailed his part. The irony that he's gay in real life, if anything, it shows how much of a topnotch actor he is. I mean seriously, without him, the show would've lost a lot of fun. Of course Robin Scherbatsky's charisma, Ted mosby's kind heart, Marshall and Lily's naivety also added a lot. By the time you finish the show, you feel like you've said goodbye to your friends. I'd say it's one of the best comedy sitcoms ever, alongside Friends.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is funny, spunky, and original. Each character is well-acted as each subtle nuance of their psyche is revealed.Neil Patrick Harris as Barney as first may seem to be cliché, but he ends up being someone who puts his true self out there in a way that says he doesn't care what people think while at the same time caring about his friends.Cobie Smulders is great as Robin. The chemistry between Robin and Barney is exciting, and I can't wait to see the next reaction.Filling out this line-up with the hilarious Alyson Hannigan, Josh Radnor and Jason Segel as a brilliant trio of Lily, Ted and Marshall allows us to see just how well the third wheel really does fit in.I can't wait each week to see the next episode and I don't care how long it takes those kids to learn how Dad met their mother, I'm along for the ride.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is a really nice series to watch when you want to kill time. The plot is simple to follow and you do not need to remember many things from past episodes in order to follow it. It is really entertaining to watch and funny at times. The cast is also really good and it matches the characteristics of their respective roles really well.However it comes with some drawbacks. I personally hated the ending, along with the entire last season, which was basically a waste of time. Although most seasons of the show are good (the best being the 2 first seasons and the 4th one) the last one makes you feel like you've been tricked into watching all this build up for nothing. It is full of flashbacks and useless information because the writers had no ideas of how to fill screen time. On top of that the show features some really cliché values on love and relationships and at points feels a little bit stupid.Overall though, it is really pleasant to watch if you have 20 minutes to kill. As long as you do not pay as serious attention to it and its flaws it is a really good way to spend your time.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the best and I mean the best show I've ever watched, it has topped Friends and all the other comedy shows.I love How I Met Your Mother.Full 9 seasons have been watched for 4 times successfully and I think i'm going fifth 😍😍\n",
      "1 \t\t As well as funny and resourceful it's a wonderful show. I really enjoyed it very much. Romance between Robin and ted is very touchy. All characters are so appropriate and specially have mention Barney character. It's just mind blowing.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a classic, though the title is slightly misleading. Most of the series focuses on character relationships and Ted's life before he meets the mother. Although I am much younger than the target demographic, I enjoy this show anyways. Despite the amount of perverted jokes and mildly sexual content, I have been addicted to it and have re-watched it many times over. There are many inside jokes which make it all the more exciting and addicting. One character I cannot stand is Ted. He keeps falling in and out of love with people and is terrible at relationships. He always finds some sort of excuse to break up with someone and usually it is because of Robin. In my opinion, Ted falling in love with Robin AGAIN in the more recent seasons is annoying and unnecessary in my opinion. At some point later in the series Robin tells Ted that he is full of crap when he says he wants to meet \"The One\" since he always chases the wrong women. I completely agree and don't see why Ted never noticed that himself. He is not a funny character and does not have the charisma that the other lead roles have. Barney, Robin, Marshall, and Lily on the other hand are all extremely likable characters (especially Barney). I also haven't seen Friends so I can't give my opinion on how similar the shows may or may not be. My friend who has watched Friends says that the characters show some similarities but the main plots and themes of the shows are wildly different. Overall, this show is extremely enjoyable if you don't mind a bit of crude humor and you don't mind watching 8 whole seasons. It's worth it.\n",

      "0 \t\t Hated it. It was so shallow and uninteresting. The stories were not relatable for an international audience. Especially hated the fact the it was everywhere, all the time being showed on tv and everything that had an audience. I felt bombarded by its unfunny and ridiculous jokes. Everyone was sleeping with everyone to the point you lost track of who was who and with who. The characters were shallow and exaggerated. I hope I would never see this tv series ever again!\n",

      "1 \t\t I adored How I Met Your Mother and watching for 9 years. nI would have given it 10/10 if it wasn't for the ending of the mother dies and he gets together with robin. The final scene should have been at 18mins and 7 seconds. Anything after that is an abomination. Ted shouldn't have ended with Robin as well as Barney and Robin should have stayed together. 9 seasons ruined in 1 season. RIP\n",

      "When they broke Barney and Robin Up and the \"Mother\" died and Ted and Robin got back together I thought it was the worst possible ending I have ever seen on any long running tv show. I dislike the ending so much I refuse to watch any of the reruns. I don't know what they were thinking. They Ended one of my favorite shows of all time in a way they makes me mad every time I see one of the cast on something else or when I come across a rerun. What a shame.\n",

      "And it is honestly\n",
      "But the last season left me really disappointed and angry\n",
      "All they did was skipped out a lots of things which could've been shown\n",
      "Maybe Season 10??\n",
      "The Ted and Tracy thing went really fast\n",
      "And yes killing her was really bad idea tbh\n",
      "The ending could have been so so much better and thats my only complain\n",
      "at the end of the day amazing show\n",
      "1 \t\t I have watched this 3 times now. Its emotional, funny, meaningful and just good all around.10/10 would watch again, and again, and again...\n",
      "0 \t\t I was a little confused and frustrated after watching the last two episodes. It's like after watching a whole 9 seasons, with toughts and emotions coming along the way, at the end I was put in the situation were I have to negate a good part of them.\n",
      "And the most confusing for me was how they've written Barney. It was a total mess. How could the writers, for 3 seasons long, try to convince us that the bad guy has finally changing (which by the way is very emotionally touching) and in one single episode trough all that hopes in the dumpster, without even showing what happened there. What the hell was that?\n",
      "And I don't even want to say anything about the very ending, which is practically saying \"Good, you watched till the end. Well, you could've watch the first episode and... that's it.\"\n",
      "1 \t\t well umm...to be at least saying about the review...well i really don't consider myself of that level to really write about such great artists and not the least for that fantastic and awesome show.....in a nut shell all the characters n especially neil's are just out of the world....the way they really touch down your throat is awesome.... needless to say this show has become a very important part of my life..its like i shud see at least 1 episode daily with maximum ranges from 1-1.5 seasons..... eagerly waiting for their (unofficially announced) 8th season... u guyzz are legen................wait for it darrrrrryyyyyyyyy.... love u all radnor, cobie, neil, jason, lily n nora...:D\n",
      "1 \t\t The ending was a little bitter but it was the best comedy ever in my opinion ^__^\n",
      "1 \t\t In one word, LEGENDARY. The writers and behind the scenes cast have done an awesome job. Not since \"Seinfeld\" finished , has a show really captured my imagination like HIMYM. The cast have really made the characters their own, which is testament to how good they are. Josh Radnor plays \"Ted\", your average guy on the lookout for Mrs. Right , accompanied by his college buddies , Lily (Allison Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segel) as well as .... Wait for it , .... Barney (Neil Patrick Harris)!. Marshall is your typical small town guy and supportive buddy. Lily , on the other hand , can be sweet and understanding for one , but can still deliver a knockout laugh. By far, the best character is Barney , always one step ahead of the viewers with his pyrotechnics and quirky one liners. And joining them for the ride is Robin (Cobie Smulders) who , like the rest of the cast , will throw a laugh your way when you least see it coming. For those who haven't watched this as yet , once you guys watch the pilot , you'll know what you've been missing , and be hooked, i certainly was :).\n",
      "1 \t\t To be perfect honest, sitcoms are not my favorite kind of entertainment. I have started watching HIMYM after much insistence of my friends and much to my surprise I liked the way the story was told: It really appears is a person telling the story. There are moments when the storyteller forget something and go back, split parts of a story, mix it with other events, and put her personal impression about the others characters, events and places where the story happens. To my utter astonishment, the original script was ready before the third season streaming, and all the scenes that the children participates had already been recorded. During the sixth to eighth season there are many episodes that are not related to main story or does not quite up to same high standards. The last season left me on the edge of my seat, though it becomes quite rush (the finale episode does not have 2 hours of duration) and disappointing to me and probably to many others fans who wanted to watch more moments of Ted and \"mother\". Even so this sitcom is not to be missed.\n",
      "1 \t\t this show is so much fun, and so lovable. i love the interaction between the characters. i have seen all these actors on other shows, and it is so nice to see their abilities displayed in a great setting. besides, barney is hilarious. and, i must say, i'll sometimes catch other sitcoms but this is the only sitcom i tape every week to watch. this is the first show in a long time that i can't wait to watch. and the suspense is killing me. although, i don't really want to know how he met their mother - cause then the show might have to end. and i would be sad. and, i was very sad to see the end of victoria - i really liked her. but, that won't stop me from watching. i don't think enough people appreciate the loveliness of this show.\n",
      "1 \t\t This the best sitcom i have ever seen . The journey of ted is awesome . The characters in this series are so awesome . I love them like i used to love harry potter characters (still do ) . If we evaluate on basis of story line , relation to characters , there bonding , comic plots, hands down How i met your mother is a delight to watch . Its so sad that its over and we will not see the legendary Barnie or Ted or Marshall and pretty Robin and Lilly but i will always be watching the previous episodes with all my heart . I hope we get a new season or a movie or anything remotely related to these people . i will surely watch it. Coming down to my rating if you have never watched this you should try it at this moment. and that will be best 22 minutes of your day. Try binge watching if you can . Story line - 10 , Characters - 10 , catch phrases - 10 legendary , running gags - 10 . overall - 10. awesome .\n",
      "1 \t\t Everyone knows whta I'm talking about, the entire series is amazing, with great characters, jokes, storytelling and narrative, but the ending makes the entire series seem pointless, ruining almost all characters (specially Barney)\n",
      "1 \t\t The show is really entertaining it captivates you\n",
      "With its humor and emotions and builds up the excitement towards the mother who is the soulmate of the protagonist 'Ted Mosby 'whom he refers to as 'the one' but she is very short lived even in the story and even in the screen time of the show, and two of the protagonist best friends Robin and barley's love drama were portrayed as they were made for each other and a whole season was dedicated to their marriage but they broke up within a short span, and mostly the main driving force which kept the excitement alive the mother character who deserved more than the teeny screen time and an untimely death was not well suited and even though the ending sucked its still a wonderful show.\n",
      "1 \t\t The show was actually good it but the ending wasn't it.\n",
      "1 \t\t I heard lots of good things about this show. The trailer were always really funny but they never drew me in. However on day I decided to give it a try. I was hooked! After watching one episode I started from the beginning and watch the previous seasons.This show is really good. It's very funny. I love how the jokes and themes from previous episodes always apply to the newer episodes. For example, the play book. And the lines are simply legendary. The story line is really good as well. The story line is about the main character telling his children how he met their mother, hence the title. It's like a comedic mystery. How I Met Your Mother is a really entertaining show. It's nice to watch after a long day. I can't wait to for more episodes and find out who the mother is and how the story ends.\n",
      "1 \t\t I will try to be as clear and fair in this review. So first things first, as a sitcom How I met Your mother is a great series to watch, its funny, smart (in the majority of the seasons) and pleasing to watch. The only issue must be that it isn't a just a sitcom but it combines some romantic and in rare cases some drama(ofcourse not in a high level but the series isnt always cheerful)so unless you relate to the story and in the whole concept, you probably wont enjoy it the most. The first 4 seasons are really good and smart with great ideas, the 5-7 were ok but the fall was definitely start getting noticed. The last 2 seasons werent that awful but more like not that intresting. The final season had good concept and good execute but the finalle of it kinda killed it of. I dont want to spoil anything but prolly you have already heard about it the only very negative part is the finale,its was very dissapointing but suprising too. Now in my personal experience I started this series as a in love teenager and also wanted to try something new except action movies and series. And I really loved it. I got relate with the character very fast and the whole story captured me. Many episodes and occasions were very familiar to my real life (such as love dissapointments, some depression here and there etc.) so that helped me keep going. Personally I never found my self getting bored over it but Im sure some people will find it tiring cause sometimes it gets too repetitive. By now I have watched it 3 total times + visiting some of my favorite episodes so I can have a laugh or find comfort. Overall How I met Your Mother is a great series if you like sitcoms, romance and comedy, its well writen there aren't many (to none, I could add) plot holes and its really entertaining. Hope this helped you out .\n",
      "1 \t\t You guys are family thanku for everything. Ted , Lily marshal, robin , dady home..!! Barney and Tracy you guys are not there but still there for me in every situation every mood and my in lonely life.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this sitcom, the story it's amazing and I can watch it over and over again. The sad and funny story about Ted is really great and I think Barney is the most interesting character who is doing a great job being an idiot all the time.\n",
      "1 \t\t Jason Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Alyson Hannigan in a show together. Do I really need to say anything more?Well, apparently I do. There is a ten-line minimum, so I reckon I may have to go a bit more in-depth. The show is hilarious. I like that it can be watched as stand-alone episodes, but is really a single continuous story. The characters are great, and have some wonderful dialogue/one-liners. Barney, Neil Patrick Harris's character is like a wittier live-action version of Quagmire from Family Guy. Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan compliment each other perfectly and work really well as a couple. The exchanges between the two are wonderfully written, and often just as cute as they are entertaining. I highly recommend this show. It's one of the best playing right now. Please watch it. I'd hate for it to be cancelled.\n",
      "1 \t\t The first few years this show was on I had heard of it but never bothered to give it a chance. One day I caught an episode and first I noticed Neil Patrick Harris... then I noticed the guy from that Sarah Marshall movie... then I simply fell in love with the show. I have watched the entire series to date 4 times now and the development of the characters is just brilliant and amazing. You really get to know the quirks and life stories as this story progresses. The style of story telling in the show is absolutely just hilarious because it is always exactly how we remember things whether it be exaggerated or with missing holes in the story because well we simply forgot. The cast is incredible and the perfect mix of comedy and drama make it the best TV show I've ever gotten into. I'd love to shake the hand of the person that came up with this show because it's made me laugh in my worst days and you know what damnit I've even had a tear or two pop out during some episodes. Amazing show let's just hope it keeps going.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is a breathe of fresh air. I really am enjoying it. It's the kind of sitcom that you wish were a movie so you could see the rest of it. After Everybody Loves Raymond I was wonder if and when there would be another sitcom that I would like and if it would be soon. It was more than I wanted. I am so pleased and hope that it continues to go on and stay on the air. I would also like to see Josh's and the rest of the cast biography on the Internet Movie Data Base web site. I would also like to see the reruns come on TV after the show goes on in about 10 years- like Raymond. I wish you success on and off the set. Right on! Keep up the good work. Also, I really hope that this sitcom stays clean and doesn't get too sexy or too many sexual innuendos. Thank you!\n",
      "1 \t\t \"How I met your mother\" is one of the best TV series! It's perfect for those who love comedies and for the romantic souls. I hadn't watched it since last month. I always thought that it was the kind of comedy that only the characters and the audience laugh. One day I was so bored that I decided to watch an episode of HIMYM. After watching the first one I got hooked and I couldn't stop watching it...Every single episode is hilarious, even the dramatic ones!! You can't resist to any of the characters, they are all amazing. I now realise that I shouldn't have watched the whole series in a week. HIMYM made my day! I loved the ending (Robin was Ted's real first love, no matter how much he loved Tracy, Robin was just Robin). But I would have loved it if the scene with Lily paying up Marsall in 2030 wasn't cut! It would be the last funny moment of HIMYM!! So all in all, GO WATCH IT!!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t \"How I Met Your Mother\" is one of those shows where you can sit down one afternoon and enjoy a short 20 minute sitcom. When I first began to watch this comedic show I was straight away hooked on and could not stop watching episode after episode. I'm glad this is the first show i will watch from start to ending. Although, I long for this show to go on and on forever. The show is capable to continue to reach 10 seasons and more i believe.This series has brought many elements to it including friendship, love and cherished memories that the 'gang' share together. The series has a good plot, good writing and a great cast with good acting. The cast are very well suited to their character in the series, with Josh Radnor doing a great job in his first leading role. Cobie Smulders is a great look to the eye and Neil Patrick Harris just perfects his character as Barney; the friend suits up, sleeps with women and has his own set of rules.I give this unforgettable show a 10 out of 10.\n",
      "1 \t\t A show i fell in Love with it ..I don't usually watch a TV series, but HIMYM is a total exception! the most awesome st TV series I ever watched, yet!. I love the casts, the stories, how they put the continuity on every episodes, man I just love the show. Barney is awesomely awesome !!!!!!!!! Other characters such as Ted, who the show is about is also really funny - especially his on-and off again relationship with the character Robin. Basically, I recommend this show to anyone who just wants to watch a silly show and laugh all day long. 10 out 10 in my opinion.so Haveeee you seen HIMYM ??\n",
      "1 \t\t I really like this show. I've been watching it for a few months now and I have to say this show is as good as The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men. The Show is about Future Ted (Bob Saget) sitting his kids down one day and telling them in detail about the story on How He Met Their Mother. So far my favorite episode has to be Slap Bet where Marshall (Jason Segel) and Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) make a slap bet on why their friend Robin (Cobie Smulders) won't go inside any malls. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men. It is on CBS on Mondays. New episodes start Monday September 19th 2011.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is my favorite show about and I absolutely love, a great watch for anyone who likes Friends, The Big Bang Theory and the sort. Really excited to see the ending- Such a shame its ending but its been a fantastic show and I've loved it from the start. From the first time we met the amazing gang they gone from strength to strength and with some exceptional story-lines like Barney's Job, the Goat and Marshall's career it truly one of the modern day greats. Truth be told I'm watching it now and I just love it, nothing beats their bar booth and I just love their cab rides, and no true review of HIMYM can be made without a hat-tip towards the might of Neil Patrick Harris- a god in the making.\n",
      "0 \t\t I recently binge watched the entire show and loved it. There wasn't a character that I disliked. The show doesn't start to get boring in later seasons like a lot of other shows tend to do. The only part I didn't like was the ending. I really hated how they ended the show. The last two episodes are two episodes I won't rewatch. I really which they ended it off better.*Spoilers Ahead*In the end the thing I didn't like was that they made Robin and Barney get divorced when they were perfect for eachother. They ended up killing off the mother in the finale. I also didn't like the very last scene where Ted brings Robin the blue horn and basically asks her out. There is no scene of him asking Barney if he can date her which is messed up because Barney put his entire proposal plan in Ted's hands early. But Ted didn't even ask if he could date one of his best friends ex-wife. Overall the ending is very bad.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show. Ted is a good character, people always seem like they want to find something wrong with him and then they'll complain about a flaw he has. People don't realize how well he helps out Barney. I bet Barney wouldn't be as good without Ted. I find the series to be the best at when Ted and Barney are single. Barney, i think is the show, he's not here and the characters and the show is useless. Marshall and Lily are good character place holders, those 2 help out other characters to make jokes and story lines. Robin though, I liked her until her and Barney. It stopped Barney from hitting on girls, and from then on, Robin was a sl*t, sleeping with every guy(but Kevin). I think this show is coming to an end soon cause Marshall and Lily are having a baby, and Barney wants to settle down. We know the show is running out of story lines so bad that they're marrying Barney. No more hitting on girls, alter egos, etc. I think the show will end with the mother being someone we know, they'll find some loophole. I want the mother to be Victoria, she's hot and she seems right with Ted, out of all of Ted's 4 main gfs(Victoria,Robin,Stella,Zoey) she was the best with him, Robin is going to be with Barney and she's a sl*t. Stella left Ted at the altar. Zoey and Ted argued over everything. I use to say Robin, but she wants to go back with Barney, and she seemed happier with Barney than Ted, plus she's a sl*t and she can't have kids. All in all, this show is great, but I don't like how it's heading.\n",
      "0 \t\t I dont understand why they have to take 24 episodes for worst end ever, very weak scenario just adding moments.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is my favorite show of all time and I have a feeling that it will always be.It has always been there for me and has made me feel every emotion under the sun.This show has a lot of heart and brain behind it and combines both its light hearted parts and its more serious parts to creates a wonderful narrative that pulls you in from the start.The cast has done a wonderful job of portraying these characters and made them loved my millions across the world.I won't speak to much on the ending but it has grown on me over time\n",
      "and I think it does a great job depicting the unfortunate and tragic reality of what life is. It includes death, sorrow, disappointment and I actually think that makes the show feel even more real and great.In the end this show can truly only be described in one word.LEGEN...Wait for it..DARY\n",
      "LEGENDARY.\n",
      "1 \t\t In Australia we have only had 5 episodes of this show, but it's on prime time Thursdays, and appears to be a favorite, for me, love it, the twists, the acting of the characters, and the plots are all great, hope the producers do take up another season or more. The OK Awesome episode, was great, the difference between being with the future partner, or sneaking out to be with the mates, was so real to life for a lot of people, and standing in line trying to enter a club/venue for the rich/popular and then finding the person dancing alone turns out to be your cousin, and the final scene with the make out on the dance floor, brings this to a end. (sorry prob boring write, never done this before, will improve). I hope you all enjoy as much as I did\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is one of the few fantastic comedy shows out there. And i would recommend it for you to try it. \n",
      "A special thing about this show is that it outstandingly pointed out the each character's specialty and history, it's all gonna make sense if you watch it. But if you haven't watched this show, at least give it a try for the first 10 episodes. You will love the characters, they're all so different and hilarious. For example Barney is a hot playboy who wants a different girl in bed with him every night while Ted is the opposite. He wants to find the mother of his children, \"the one\", and he will search for that especial thing desperately till he finds it. He's more of a sweet guy who will love a girl with all his heart. And you will get good laughs at their hilarious adventures, and believe me, you won't be bored for one second once you get hooked to the show. It is a hilarious, real, a little sad love story. But hey, life isn't perfect, romance isn't perfect. The perfect love of your life doesn't just knock on your door in the morning. \n",
      "Watch it, NOW!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a show I've loved since the first season, and now that I've watched and re watched it all, the shows various flaws are remarkably clear. The show is very unoriginal, borrowing much from other sitcoms, most predominately, Friends. The show also has a few jokes which come up multiple times throughout a given season, and they are incredibly irritating every time I hear these awful jokes. However, the show doesn't have to be original to be fantastic. HIMYM uses and builds upon dozens of various sitcom tropes and is the better for it. The new story telling ability of Future Ted telling his kids a story is brilliant, as that combined with wonderful music and directing leads to many heartfelt goosebumps good moments. I absolutely love this hilarious show and could go on for hours giving many reasons why!\n",
      "1 \t\t Loved the show, especially for the ending. A lot of laughing and a lot of crying at the last two episodes.A late watcher via Netflix.\n",
      "1 \t\t Don't get me wrong, the ending was great.Truly surprising and a great sign off a long standing mystery. But the wedding season was just so awful. It seemed like minutes ticked by the hour and also it became all too melodramatic. With Robin unsurprisingly freaking out before the wedding. Just so predictable with Ted calming her. It seemed like the gang spent an eternity at the Farhampton Inn. I think we were all glad when the wedding finally did happen, more so than the bride and groom in fact. But I guess we were all missing the good old seasons which were actually quite funny. Ending was great though but I had a sneaky feeling from the very first episode that Ted and Robin are going to end up. Easy for me to say it now but it's true!\n",
      "1 \t\t I watched the first season of this sitcom and I can say it is not that funny. Sitcoms are always easy to watch and I dont think I have seen bad sitcoms. It depends a lot on characters and big problem is that I dont like most of characters in here, also almost nothing is funny which is bad for show that supposed to make me laugh. Good part of How I met Your Mother is that I think story/drama is pretty good but I still think it is more important that it would be funny first since Sitcoms arent really for story and if I compare this to normal shows like True Detective or Sopranos than story is extremly weak but when comparing to other sitcoms like The Third Rock from the Sun or FRIENDS I think it is pretty good. Speaking about FRIENDS resemblences are pretty clear. Even characters are:\n",
      "Rachel - Robin,\n",
      "Chandler - Marshall,\n",
      "Ross - Ted,\n",
      "Monica - Lily,\n",
      "Joey + Phoebe - Barney.\n",
      "Characters makes FRIENDS really funny while in How I met Your Mother, characters are pretty lame and it is not funny because of the characters, with expection to Barney since a lot of stuff is funny because of his characters. For example Chandler with his sarcasm makes situations extremly funny while Marshall funny part supposed to be what? That he is still like a teen? Maybe I just have different taste for comedy thats why I dont find most of this show funny and I dont think I will continue to watch more seasons.\n",
      "1 \t\t Unique characters, wacky episode plot lines and the suspenseful mystery of the mother are what I appreciate in this show. It's not on the brilliance level of Seinfeld or madmen but it's something that I enjoyed watching on netflix while cooking/cleaning in the kitchen, like downton abbey, veronica mars, pretty little liars and the good wife. It certainly reminds me of friends (now I'm excited for friends on netflix!) . I liked the ending and this show actually made me cry a few times despite being more of a comedy. My favourite character is Ted, I think he's the most multi-faceted. The show has a good theme and I felt the endings of the various story lines /relationships were well written, plus we see the growth of each of the 5 main character (unlike, for example, gossip girl which could have done way more with Nate but seemed to give up!) There are some good minority characters and I am actually not one to mind that the main cast is white, and Ted's girlfriends dates are mainly white. I have to say that the number of fat jokes is pretty astronomical and there is sometimes an iffy feeling about some of the jokes/approaches to black and Asian people. And in none of those cases was it really really funny to be worth the offence. Since I've never lived in NYC I'm not really sure how offencive that kind of talk is locally but I find this one of the least PC shows I've seen lately.\n",
      "1 \t\t I really enjoyed this series,it's awesome.Great story line, nice presentation every thing just too good. It's one of the best sitcoms on the air and one of the best CBS shows!I don't know if I have enough to say to fill up ten lines. I basically wanted to say that I think this is a funny show, and I hope the network keeps it. I especially like the twists and sense of mystery.My favorite character is Barney. He is probably the main person I watch the show for. He is funny and brings a certain \"something' to TV that it needs.Trust me guys I have copied the comments to make my review reach a minimum of 10 line. But still the fast that remains true is that I really love this show.\n",
      "1 \t\t This puts a somewhat somber spin on a great comedic show, but it also solves a lot of problems that many people, including me, had with the 9th season.Ted never had children. He was an unreliable narrator. He often joked and embellished, albeit in a charming dad-like sort of way. In almost a Barney way. But, at heart, he was a storyteller, and he had some great stories to tell.After years of searching, Ted finally did find the mother, the love of his life, his perfect person. Someone who would laugh at his often very, very unfunny jokes. And then she died. And it utterly destroyed Ted.My theory is that much of the story was real, though exaggerated. But when the mother died, Ted was crushed. There is a moment in the episode Vesuvius that, inadvertently or not, supports the theory.\"You're the love of my life Pooh Bear. I just worry about you. I don't want you to be the guy who lives in his stories.\" But Ted did, in fact, live in his stories after she died. It was all he had left, all that he could cling to.In the bleak Symphony of Illumination episode, Robin told a seemingly cute story to her fictional children about how she met their father, Barney. At the end, she let them know that they never existed. They faded out, and she was sad and alone, on a snowy bench in Central Park.This, regrettably, parallels Ted's story.Season 9 had a weirder premise than the rest of the seasons. There were some very funny moments, but, from a narrative standpoint, there was an unnecessary amount of time spent on one wedding weekend in light of Barney and Robin's eventual divorce after only three years.However, under my theory, Ted is telling this story to himself. He purposefully dragged out the story for years, for as long as possible. With strange non sequiturs and side-quests. Almost to the point of absurdity.But it's because Ted knew what was coming. The death of his wife. And he was not ready to accept it. So he fabricated happier times.When Ted neared the end of the story, he did not want to let the mother go. Thus, the interminable 9th season. He lengthened their tale. Trying to hold on to her a few months, a few days, a few minutes longer.If Ted got to the point in the story when he and the mother met, it would signal the beginning of the end. \"How I Met Your Mother\" led up to meeting his future wife. But he knew that when he reached the end, his love, his best friend, would be dead. He could not cope.Storyteller that he is, Ted created a happy ending, even though he knew it was a lie. Ted with a blue French Horn outside of Robin's apartment. It's a nice facade, appropriate symmetry, a semblance of normalcy that kept him from completely lapsing into despair. But the fiction didn't work.Many people are critical that we didn't get to spend more time with the mother. Every time she was on screen, she was wonderful. They could have made a whole show about her.But Ted's the narrator, and some things are too painful to revisit. And we also kind of get a sense of how he feels. That he didn't get to spend enough time with her.\"I worry about you.\" Even when she was dying, she worried about Ted. And that devastated him. That he cried in front of her when he thought about living without her. That she had to comfort him. When all he wanted was to distract her and make her final days peaceful.She knew how upset he was. But she tried not to let it show. She always was the stronger one. And she knew that her death would overwhelm Ted. But there wasn't much she could do. So she smiled. And she laughed. And she made jokes. She always was very clever. But still, she knew that her death would shatter Ted. And he knew. And he knew she knew. And she knew he knew she knew. Which made her death all that more agonizing. God's cruel joke.The show never revealed what happened after the French Horn scene. I believe it would cut to the present, Ted talking to his kids. But, like Robin's, his children fade away. The wall behind them, that seemed to show pictures and memories of Ted and his kids, fades away too. It's blank. The house also looks kind of run-down and dilapidated. The money pit that he bought and spent years trying to build into a home for his future family is empty and cold.After the mother's death, Ted was defeated. We now see Ted at his desk, an open almost-empty bottle of Glen McKenna on the surface. He has grey hair and the same sweater he was wearing in the final episode. He's bleary-eyed. Not as desolate as he was in Vesuvius. \"What mother is gonna miss her daughter's wedding?\" He's just staring.He looks too thin. His eyes are sunken. His cheeks are hollow. He's numb, heartbroken, detached. No friends are there to console him. They tried at first, but they gave up long ago.There was a running gag on the show that Ted would never find his soulmate, that he would always be alone. It was lighthearted, good for a laugh. And we got through most of the show before he did find his true love. But he was never alone. He always had his friends. Now, he's lost his love and his friends. He's lost everything.The camera lingers on his face for an uncomfortably long time. Maybe twenty seconds. Then, black.\n",
      "1 \t\t Great show with a terrible final season/ending.You don't need a long drawn out review if you are here, you have an idea of what the show is about.\n",
      "1 \t\t Love the show ,so many emotions; charecters are so impressive they leave tramp stamp in our hearts.\n",
      "1 \t\t I am in love with this show. I don't watch too much television, but this is the ONE show I HAVE to watch every week. It's my only reason for liking Mondays again! Neil Patrick Harris is a genius in the role of Barney, he's amazing! I love it. \"Okay, Awesome\" the episode at the club, honestly, I almost fell out of my chair laughing when he told Ted who he'd been dancing with all night. Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel have perfect chemistry for the characters, and poor Josh Radnor's Ted is incredibly believable.If this isn't picked up, I may boycott TV for a while...Okay, and one more rant about Barney: His \"liberal\" use of the word \"legendary\" made my week when that episode aired. A couple of my friends and I are actually using it in conversation now... because as we all know, \"it's going to be LEGENDARY!\"\n",
      "1 \t\t I really enjoyed the show during all the seasons, and my opinion was that this is the best sitcom ever (even better than Friends). I don't know why, the end of the show put all my expectations out. Because of that, I rated the show with 9, not 10. I wish I didn't watch the end of the story How I Met Your Mother. However, I still watch some random episodes which I still enjoy (some episodes i have watched 4-5 times). Favorite character? Barney and Lilly.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just finished watching all the season for the first time recently and I admit....it is definitely an amazing series.\n",
      "1 \t\t The ending ruined of this movie ruined my favorite show of all time. The pathetic and totally disgusting ending that didn't make a sense at all, made me hate all of three of my favorite characters, Barney, Robin and most of all Ted, not to mention his cold blooded kids who didn't give a single crap about their mother's memory.\n",
      "I loved this show with all my heart, I had been rooting for Robin and Barney's relationship, because the chemistry between them was real, also their love story was a central point of Barney's character development, that was very skillfully built by the writers until the final episode.\n",
      "I just wish I had not watched it, it broke my freaking heart.\n",
      "I decided to rewatch the series but knowing the ending ruins even the best parts of the best episodes that I used to enjoy A LOT.\n",
      "Thank you very much, the directors. I guess you hit your head right before writing the final episode of the show. Otherwise you owe me an apology.\n",
      "0 \t\t It's gonna be LEGEN'.... wait for it... 'DARY.\n",
      "Yeah... Legendary 😁\n",
      "~ Barney Stinson\n",
      "1 \t\t After spending 2 straight days watching the entire 2 first seasons, I have a mixed feeling on this show.First of all it's fun. Not as much as \"Two and half Men\" or \"According to Jim\", but it's enjoyable.The main plot is not really followed, after 44 episodes we still haven't met \"The Mother\" and it's all about several mini stories or revolving too much for my taste around the Marshall-Lily longterm relationship Some flashbacks are bringing depths to the characters, and some revelations on how the characters acted by the past and some \"time rewarding\" episodes to explain the cascade of events are cool The characters are good, but Barney and Robin totally surpass the others, the show would be lame if not for them The problem is that Marshall is like an empty shell, the actor is good, but the character has no depth, Lily is \"too much\" ans dumb, and the main character Ted is really dull, with nothing special at all except looking for the woman of his life Robin is sparkling by her beauty and tormented soul, and with Barney the Don Juan, they are totally saving this show I hope we have some answers on the third season\n",
      "1 \t\t SPOILERS FROM FRIENDS & HIMYMWhile I know it has a lot in common with \"Friends\", I think that HIMYM did a much better job.I literally cried when Friends ended, not because it ended, because the end was just so stupid and unrealistic (the Ross and Rachel part of it). In my personal opinion, Friends is just trying too hard to be funny and forgets to be even the slightest bit REAL. HIMYM does seem to have that problem (of course there are moments here and there but overall I think it keeps it real).Even though it didn't end as we all would have expected, it wasn't something I had a hard time accepting. The gang changes over the seasons, it grows, it even falls apart, just like in real life. Ted running after Robin was at that point quite unexpected, but sometimes people do unexpected things.Bottom line, Tracy will always be the love of Ted's life, but after her death and at that age, he needs Robin, maybe more as a friend than a lover but think about it, they know each other, they have been lovers, and they're tired of dating (realising that the won't love anyone as much as they loved Barney/Tracy) so it really makes sense that they would spend the rest of they're lives together.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show, how i met your mother has one of the best writings. This one has humor, comedy, a particular style where one can productively waste time with. Every character in this show is awesome. Barney makes is own theories and follow it. Ted is so desperate to have a women as is wife, in his constant search for true love. Marshal is so truthful to his wife that he cant even fantasize about other women. Robin is strong and very confident to herself. I particularly like Barney's mermaid theory which i feel to absolutely true. When sailors went off sailing in the sea they were so desperate to see a woman that anything in the shape of a women's bod they were tempted. they felt the seals as half women and half fish and imagined them to be mermaids.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the best tv-series one can get to watch. The perfect fusion of drama, romantic comedy ,adult comedy ,etc . This show is recommended to every human being who understands sarcasm .\n",
      "1 \t\t (not sure if it contains spoilers):P Well the season finale was too confusing. some questions and paradoxes crossed my mind.The way Barney proposed to Quin was really emotional and after seeing all that... i see Robin as Barney's Bride !! so is Quin evil ?or is it one of Barney's master plans to make Robin realize ?Is Ted again making a huge mistake ? ORIf Victoria is the real mother then were the kids never told their moms name? (LOL) I am a big fan and I do dearly love all the characters and have followed HIMYM from the beginning, but the season finale.... really made me feel if i have wasted my time trying to expect something really surprising... or had i derived the Show already...\n",
      "1 \t\t But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\n",
      "1 \t\t HIMYM has a great storyline which perfectly fits for my taste. I love the selection of actors which are playing their roles incredibly good. The final episode really made my eyes wet! I've watched it 2 or 3 times but i would definitely rewatch it soon!\n",
      "1 \t\t Love the sense and quality of the show, and I have \"Ted Mosby-ed\" (\"I think I'm in love with you.\") this show since the first few episodes of season 1. I have watched the episodes (seasons 1-4) more than twice (honestly) and even the five-year old jokes still keep me laughing out loud.Even the websites in which the characters have mentioned in the show are quite awesome; Barney's blog/twitter, tedmosbyisajerk.com, guyforceshiswifetodressinagarbagebagforthenextthreeyears.com, etc. - he he he.I, for one, am glad to have met this show! Now on season 5 and still rocking! Season 6 (and more) - keep it (them) coming! To those who said they didn't love the show, I guess I'll have to 'Lemon Law' you! Go for Barney!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is my favorite show on TV today. At first I didn't know what the show was about when my friend showed some episodes to me on Netflix when the show was in its 7th season. Since I thought the show was funny we stared watching from the beginning instead of episodes he thought were especially funny. We would watch a couple of episodes every time we hung out witch was about three times a week. Unfortunately our work schedules collided and we couldn't hang out as much. Since I had a job then I joined Netflix to watch the rest of the seasons to get caught up for the 9th and final season. I definitely would recommend anyone who has access to all the seasons to watch them, it is a great show and really funny. For those that don't know anything about the show there are five main characters Ted (Josh Radnor), Marshal (Jason Segel), Barney (Neil Patrick Harris), Lilly (Alyson Hannigan), and Robin (Cobie Smulders). The show is about how Ted meets his future wife going through all his past girlfriends and all the crazy adventures him and his friends have had leading up to when Ted finally meets his wife. Marshal is Teds best friend from college. Marshal is from St. Cloud Minnesota going to NYU to become an environmental lawyer to stop pollution from big oil companies. Ted and Marshal met due to being roommates who didn't like each other at first. Lilly is Marshals girlfriend who also met each other the first day of college and has been dating ever since. Barney is a womanizer that Ted meats in the bar called MacLaren's that Ted, Marshal, and Lilly live on top of in New York and hang out in all the time. How Ted and Barney became friends is that Barney not only wouldn't leave Ted alone, but also knew how to get any woman to sleep with him and dubbed Ted and his wingman. Ted and Robin met at MacLaren's as well, but Ted had a case of \"love at first sight\" with Robin across the bar. Unfortunately Ted ruined his first try by saying \"I think I'm in love with you\" to Robin on the first date. In my opinion it is defiantly a Legen-wait for it –Dairy show.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I watch \"How I met your mother\" I dont care about the end destination or the final minute reaviling a big plot twist. NO. I sit back and enjoy the journey of laughter and clever qoutes.Time and time again when i have recommended this show to friends and family. they can not find the patiance to watch multipole episodes and grow to like the characters. HIMYM recuires a real connection between the characters and the spectators in order to be entertaining.A connection like this can be difficult to get with a show after only one episode. I usually recommend watching 3-4 episodes with friends because it brings out that laugther you otherwise would not get. given that in social settings we laugh more often.my moment when i really connected with the show was when Barney said \"you just know she likes it dirty\". hope this was usefull (:\n",
      "0 \t\t This is one of those shows that people talked about a little before it aired and then was canceled within the season. Thanksfully, too, because it was pretty stock and really bland.The characters are your typical run of the mill prime-time lot. Obnoxious friend, best friend ever-friend -- all have their relationship quirks. Neil Patrick Harris is obviously trying very hard to ditch his Doogie persona. The girl from Buffy and American Pie is, well, nothing new -- she's always been boring and this go around seems none-to-different. The others seem to be from other defunct show, as well, but who can tell? They're all so boring.The above described is pretty much a turn off, but nothing too bad. Unless, of course you stick around and actually watch it. It has lame attempts at humor -- a crack about a smurf penis lands square on its face as does the whole eye-patch business. The fleshing out of the characters is just oh-so-cute. The roomie is getting engaged-- whoopty-doo. Doogie throws around phrases like \"let's suit up!\", which is intended to cement his character as a guy who likes to party in a three piece armani. The main character -- who really cares what he's called or who he's played by -- really wants to get married himself and he'll go to any length to do it. Just like any man. Yup. Just like any man.This is one of those shows you know they studio was all excited about. Luckily for the rest of the country, it will vanish before it has a chance to do any damage.\n",
      "0 \t\t How i met your mother is my comfort show. I have been watching this show since i was 12 (im 20 now), & this show is just my everything. I have seen this show fully through over 50 times, & i can tell you that on my like 56th watch right now, this holds up. The ending sucks & i will never support it, if you know you know. But it is just so heartwarming & funny & teaches you life lessons that you know, but being told by this philosophical narrator perspective make it sit so well. This show will never get old for me, if you're looking for something to start binge watching on a rainy night, or a cold winter day, or a warm summer evening, literally anytime... how i met your mother is the show for you.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is my favourite show of all time. I absolutely love it. I love the actors, the script... The only reason that I didn't give a 10 is because of the ending. I realise that some wanted it and that it presented growth and whatever nonsense, but Barney and Robin's love and the whole relationship was perfect and they ruined Barney's effort to win over Robin and their whole love in just a won freaking episode. I will forever love this show, but I just pretend that the last episode doesn't exist.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother will always have a special place in my heart. I grew up with this series and I grew up with it's protagonist, I laughed with him, I cried with him and till the end I couldn't stop rooting for him. It's a very heart touching series. I learnt many valuable life lessons from this show. Thank you Carter bays and Craig Thomas for making this show so memorable for me.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just cant stop crying, the last episode was so unexpected, but it was like it should be!\n",
      "1 \t\t Thank u E4 for broadcasting this funny heartwarming program 2 - 4 times a day. Gave me something to look forward to\n",
      "0 \t\t I wonder when they started writing the show how much did want to copy friends even in the ending when it doesn't make sense that robin the worst character of all time by the way ends up with ted but just like Rachel and Ross thats all they cared about I thought the show was how i met your mother not how i met your aunt.\n",
      "1 \t\t Finale of HIMYM was really good. Wished that the show kept\n",
      "1 \t\t I have watched second time....the series is so so amazing.... I saw the series again with same rigor with same mood....loved it so much.... what a show guys....love you guys.... I hope I can see one of them in india\n",
      "Lots of love from India.\n",
      "1 \t\t Its a bold statement. But this is at least MY favorite sitcom. Many will argue Friends is better. But I feel that HIMYM offers even more. Its funny even after watching the show for the 3rd time from start to end. Great dynamic between the actors and the story is brilliant. I liked everything about it, and I will most likely watch is many more times in the future.Its a rollercoaster of emotions, from the daily funny converstions between the group, to Barneys hilarious challenges, and then it also touches sad life changing events such as when Marshal loses his dad, which was heartbreaking (I called my dad just to say hello after watching the episode)Great show. I love it, and miss it.Hope they make something similar in the future.\n",
      "1 \t\t You probably already heard something of this show. His premise is very simple: a father tell his children the story of how he met their mother.\n",
      "But the plot isn't very simple, because is a story of life. The real life, of what life it is really. It is not a fairy tale but it is not a nightmare either.\n",
      "Good things and bad things happens all the time, always , anywhere to everyone.\n",
      "The thing you will love the most will be,and yeah you will love it, are the main characters. They are not plain. They are people you can relate to. You will laught with them, you will cry with them and you will feel the joy they feel. The point is that they feel like real people with dreams, passion,secrets and defects. For this reasons it is not only one of the most funny show,but one of the deepest.\n",
      "And now...about the finale(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n",
      "Yeah ok,even if it is my favorite show, I have to admit the LAST SEASON was meeeeeh,but the FINALE WAS BEAUTIFUL. Like the rest of the show the finale episode doesn't do things only to do them. They show how hard reality is. The perfect ending for our doesn't exist, there will be always something bad , a tragedy, regrets,but doesn't mean we cannot be happy. Because life is full of joy,friends and especially love.\n",
      "And trust me this is the short version, it will need me a book to really tell how beautiful,funny and deep this show is.\n",
      "1 \t\t First of all, I have to admit that I haven't watched all episodes. How I Met Your Mother is brilliantly written. It's great in all aspects. The script, the actors, the production, everything. Despite the fact I haven't watched the whole show (not yet), I can still tell that it's one of the best comedy shows ever made. It's my favorite one, along with Friends. The concept is so simple: just a couple of friends who experience all these weird and funny things. The jokes are so well thought-out which makes the show very enjoyable to watch. The characters are quite different, yet there is this amazing bond of friendship. I also appreciate how they managed to really tell a story. You really get to know the character and, as the story goes on, more and more hints are dropped on who the mother is. There are also many returning elements, like the bro code. Furthermore, the actors are simply great. I honestly can't think of any flaw in the show but I'm not an expert, obviously. If you're bored, this show is the perfect thing to kill time. After you've watched one episode, you will want to see the next one and the next one, until you've completed the whole season and soon after, you will complete the whole show. That's just how these things work, it's so addictive, and How I Met Your Mother is no exception.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother has evolved from a bit of a rocky start to a genuinely heartfelt comedy. Having removed the amount of time spent with the \"children of the future\" that used to launch each episode, and moving away from the plot lines that have the audience cringing with discomfort, they have finally found good three dimensional characters for the entire cast. The comedy ranges from subtle to slapstick, however seldom is overdone. The characters that were once caricatures have settled into a real people. I find this show enjoyable and worth watching. It's not going to change your life, but it will probably leave you smiling.\n",
      "1 \t\t When I started watching it, I didn't have high expectations. Some of my friends had watched it and some of them said it's good, some of them didn't like it. I just started from the bottom and now here we are, it was life changing. During the series my priorities hanged, I realized how important is to care about your friends. After numerous twists and turns I was really happy that Ted, the main character, finally found the perfect girl for him. What I really liked, was that the show wasn't predictable. It was really thought-provoking. I especially liked that there wasn't any violence and the way how much the character cared about each other was so heart-warming. But the last episode was so shocking, I didn't like the ending at all..It was so disappointing. It's funny, because it's still one of my favorite shows, but when I think about the way it ended, I still feel bad. Wishing that I could change the ending, I started watching it all over again. Even though I have seen it twice. I recommend it for everyone who likes shows like The big bang Theory, Friends or Full House. 10 out of 10 would recommend!\n",
      "1 \t\t I just started watching this show last spring and am so grateful for syndication - I can't believe what an amazingly well-written and acted show this is! The fact that only 4 goofs are listed (1 incorrectly regarded as such, 3 for continuity) is a testament to the skill of the writers. They are remarkably consistent from season to season - no worries here about a character being Jewish one season and talking about childhood Christmas celebrations the next! At first I didn't like the gimmick of Ted telling his kids the story, but it makes for great running gags like the 'sandwiches' in college. Featuring tight story lines, witty laugh-out-loud dialog, and hilarious physical comedy bits, this show is simply outstanding.\n",
      "1 \t\t The difference between HIMYM and other sitcoms such as Friends or Scrubs is that there is a quest and a goal within the show. We know what the goal is but it's really the journey that is the real thing. I would say thats something new and exciting. I think that every person can recognize them self in this story. If you really think of your love and how you met and the things that lead up to that. As future Ted tells us. If he had not made the butterfly tattoo he wound not have met Stella. If he would not met Stella he would not have met Tony, who offered Ted the job at the university and so on. Everything happens for a reason. Enjoy the journey!\n",
      "1 \t\t Opened the account just for this fantastic serial. It would have been better if it was a better end for Robin and Barney but still so satisfied to watch all 9 seasons. Nearly never got bored, laughed and cried...\n",
      "1 \t\t I watched the show and I felt that I was a part if all those moments\n",
      "0 \t\t don't get me wrong but i see it as a \"f.r.i.e.n.d.s\" copy.. i mean its nice and all.. but it feels like I'm watching \"friends\" all over again with slightly changes made. a couple of stuff that are the similar is the coffeehouse they mostly stay at.. or even the characters of chandler,joey and Ross. barney is obviously chandler , they are both funny,got money,no one knows what they do and wear suits most of the time(yes the suit thing sound stupid but its true).joey and barney also.. just the ladies man and there is not much to say just that barney is a modern day joey :P..Ross and Ted are the ones after true love and stuff plus they both are like nerds and boring :). but its just nice not more, have a nice day ^^\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is truly in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. It has been running on CBS for seven seasons, and I am pleased to say, it is just as funny and intriguing in season seven as it was in season one.The story of How I Met Your Mother revolves around the main Character Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) as he searches for \"the one.\" He is aided in his search (and sometimes discouraged) by his group of friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). The group as a whole is a representation of the stages of life. Barney and Robin are single and go dating for the fun of it. Marshall and Lily are in a relationship that has lasted for nine years. Their relationship is stable and fulfilling. Ted is the transitional stage between being single and being in a stable fulfilling relationship.All of the actors and actresses excel in their roles, and they all bring a different style of humor to the show. This show is extremely funny and will have you literally laughing out loud.A lot of the humor is centralized in the sexual realm, which is my only complaint. I can handle a fair amount of sexual humor, but I can only take so much. It is for this reason that I gave the show 9 out of 10. The show seems to be carried by the sexual aspect, and while that is accepted by much of the culture there is a large number of people who do not watch the show because there is so much sexual humor. It would be refreshing to have a sitcom bring in different kinds of humor, so that it would appeal to a larger variety of people. I am not saying shows need to return to the good old days of \"My Three Sons,\" \"Happy Days,\" and \"Three's Company,\" but shows do need to stop relying on just sexual content.Over all this show is a great sitcom, and is extremely funny. However I would not let children and even some teens watch this show because of the content of the humor, and even some of the areas the group travels to.\n",
      "1 \t\t Never ever compare \"How I Met Your Mother(2005-2014)\" with Friends (1994-2004). This story is about a father telling his kids story about how he met their mother. Guys I just watched the finale and it was worth waiting this long to find out who's the mother. The ending of this show cannot be better than this. I definitely recommend this show to watch. (10/10)\n",
      "1 \t\t 9.5/10 great show that lasted 9 seasons 2005-2014 200 episodes\n",
      "1 \t\t Actually, there is a word for that. It's \"love.\" I'm in love with her, okay? If you're looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want, no matter how much it destroys you, it's love! And when you love someone, you just, you... you don't stop, ever. Even when people roll their eyes or call you crazy. Even then. Especially then! You just-- you don't give up! Because if I could give up... if I could just, you know, take the whole world's advice and-and move on and find someone else, that wouldn't be love. That would be... that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for. But I-- that is not what this is.Ted\n",
      "1 \t\t I'm watching all seasons at once and just arrived at the beginning of 8th.What's to say that hasn't been already...If you're looking for a plot, look elsewhere.If you're looking for a brilliance and wit, look no more.Every single season feels better than one before.Still no idea who the mom is.But hope it's Robin.Since Seinfeld it's the 1st show up to par, or so i feel.My mood is getting lower as the last episode nears (8x14 at the time).Let it never end (I need at least another 8 or more).\n",
      "1 \t\t I loved the first 2-3 seasons, but after that i had it with it..I mean how much time you need to get a girl in you life? season 4-7 were just fillers, no direction. At the end of season 7 however they leave us hooked for more, but unfortunately season 8 is all about Barney and Robin, I get that you need to do justice to all the characters but not by sidelining the main character. Season 8 does give some hope in the beginning that we will see the \"mother\" soon but in the middle there are lot of fillers.Season 1-2: 10/10Season 3-4: 9/10Season 5: 8/10Season 6-7: 6/10Season 8: 7/10Lets hope season 9 ends it and it can end on a good note rather than ending up as just another sitcom.\n",
      "1 \t\t I love this show so much, I can't wait for the next episodes to come.. I love the way Barney acts, it really suits his suit. Haha. I also loved the way Ted delivers his role. Basically, all I can say is, this show is Legen-wait for it..-dary. Oh my, The series definitely is realistic, the different personalities of the main characters in a group? The way how a couple (Lily and Marshall) with Ex-couples (Robin and Ted) and Barney. Oh, Barney. you're so funny. All I can say is, I love it. :)It's worth spending time watching the series while doing my homework. Haha.\n",
      "1 \t\t i just want to say amazing show i love the way every character fits in perfectly all the casts acting is great i have always loved seinfeld, friends and my name is earl and i did'nt think they could top those shows but they did and it is great i mean everything about its got great chemistry between the characters i don't know if its better than seinfeld friends and my name is earl but it is just as good. they couldn't of made it better i love this show and i hope it stays on the air for a long time it is still going great after like six years just caught the new episode 46 minutes a couple of nights ago and it has'nt lost its spark its still great barney is awesome robin is quirky since she's from canada and lily and Marshall are a great funny couple and ted is great this show is legend..... wait for it....dary\n",
      "1 \t\t A great story line full of emotion,humor and drama. A full fun packed roller coaster ride all the way to find the mother... one of best things is we can actually relate with the people..their situations..emotional outbreaks.. goosebumps situations....The humor and the emotion ride along in complete series ..the creators just put their best they can do. The story telling is marvelous. Intelligence is the key part in their writing. The show holds us to the vary end. kept us curious all the way..and yes end with some shock or surprise..some times it also loose grip but at same time the shows bounces back on track.yet again words are only the way to describe ..you have to feel it....go on watch HIMYM ..experience it on your own...!!!\n",
      "0 \t\t DARRRRRYYYYYY.Although ive just finished watching it (not into sitcoms) but this really changed my mind.\n",
      "0 \t\t Rabbits are cute, ducks are not. Fur is better than feathers. Ducks make annoying noises, rabbits don't. Rabbits are cuddly, ducks are hysterical (and by hysterical I don't mean funny). Rabbits are so adorable that you feel sorry and don't want to eat them, while you don't feel sorry at all while eating a duck. Rabbit muzzle or duck beak? Well, with that cute little nose and whiskers it is clear who is the winner. Rabbit's paw vs. Duck's leg/fin - again, RABBIT OF COURSE. I could go on and on...\n",
      "Finally, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck... Someone call for Duck Season because Bugs is busy eating carrots and being THE BEST!\n",
      "1 \t\t Best series of all time! I have watched the full series from start to finish ten times. The ending was perfect as nobody saw it coming, it tied up loose ends and wasn't just a typical Hollywood ending but realistic.\n",
      "1 \t\t The show had good comedy, they had very unique way of seeing life like how they invented graduation googles, mermaid theory, etc etc. It was very enlightening. But, the ending kind of a sucks. And if you are wondering after how many seasons does the mother comes i rest assure you that she does not come before season 8 or 7 something.\n",
      "1 \t\t What can I say, i probably watched this series for a thousand times.\n",
      "1 \t\t After encountering numerous memes of the various strange and hilarious conversations between the characters of HIMYM, I decided to search for their origins. I soon found the show was available on netflix so I decided to give it a shot. I started last Saturday and I am already well into season 5. This show is amazing. It has the awkwardness of \"That 70s show\" with the genius of \"Friends\". The characters can be related to in the many situations they find themselves in ,while Ted searches for the love of his life. *SPOILER* The best part in the series I believe is Robin's history as being a Canadian pop star known as Robin Sparkles and how it is Barney's goal to find the embarrassing evidence of her past.*So far I rate this series a 9.5/10 for its comedic genius.\n",
      "1 \t\t I don't think I will ever love as show as much as I love HIMYM , each season was amazing and each one tough me something, it's the series that taught me about life.**Spoilers** For Season 1 : It's just amazing, very funny, and the relationship between the 5 friends is amazing. I love Lily and Marchall and the ending of the season broke my heart. Ted saying to Robin he loves her on the first date was huge shocker, seriously, as much as he loves the mother, I doubt he will love her as much as he tough he loved Robin. And Victoria, She was amazing..I loved the first night they spent to together, she had such great chemistry with Ted ..She was so good. season rating 10/10Season 2: GREAT start, seeing the relationship between Marchall and Lily develop, how they struggled away from each-other, these two are just perfect together, THAT'S LOVE. The episode when they get back together is amazing and the ending still tears me up. Ted and Robin had great chemistry together trough this entire season, and when Robin said to Ted \" I love you\" for the first time..wow..great moment ! Awesome season ! Barney was obviously the the funny one ( Not to mention revealing Robin Sparkles ! and the amazing Lets GO THE MALL ) 9/10Season 3: How Lily and Marchall start their life as a couple, how Ted and Robin adjust to being friends again, How Ted meets Stella , and fells in love with her..and the best moment of the show, Barney Sleep WITH ROBIN ! ARE YOU KIDDING ? I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ADJUST TO THAT..FRIENDS DON'T SLEEP WITH FRIENDS EXES !..IT WAS JUST AMAZING..AND THE SEASON FINAL ..WOW ! TED Proposes to Stella ! 9/10Season 4: another great season, Ted being left at the altar, Barney and Robin struggling with their feelings, another good season, and the season final was the best season final so far..with Ted giving a hint on the mother ( she's in the class) and everyone taking \" the leap \". 8.5/10Season 5 : probably the worst season, but still very good . \"The Playbook\" is a top 5 episode of the series, and seeing Barney and Robin try to work their relationship..what a train wreck ! Robin and Don was another good couple ! Lily and Marchall thinking about babies was also a great moment. 8/10Season 6 : just for episode 13 \" Bad News\" , this is one of the best seasons, great acting and great moment , announcing the death of Marchall's death, Seriously, he loved his dad :/ Zoey and Ted was just bad, the worst of Ted's relationship..However I did like Nora and Barney ..and the end wow...Barney is getting married! This whole season actually kinda seemed to revolve around and Barney and get to know him..his words to his father \" IF YOU WERE GOING TO BE SOME LAME SUBURBAN DAD..WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR ME\" STILL MAKES ME CRY Every time 8.5/10Season 7 : EPIC ! So many great episodes, the first when Robin admits she still has feeling for Barney ..awesome! Robin meets Kevin , Barney and Nora have many great moments..Robin and Barney sleep and cheat on their partners, Robin stays with Kevin while Barney breaks up with Nora!! So much drama for a comedy but it's great ! Then a very sad episode..Robin finds out she can't have kids :( ..There's also the Ducky Tie episode, and The return of Victoria for one episode ..it was fantastic..andthen.. this is it..the best moment and my most watched moment of the entire series..end of ep 16..Ted says to Robin I love you..it made cry.. I know a lot of guys that can't get over their first true love..and this is just an example..Ted really loves Robin..He really does..it's just amazing how much he does.. :') ..we then have a great relationship of Quinn and Barney, and Ted and Victoria...but the ending..Robin is the bride ! ROBNEY ! BEST COUPLE IN ANY TV SERIES ! ..season rating 10/10\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is in my top 10, they really make u feel like ur in the group along with them...\n",
      "1 \t\t This show completely took me by surprise, with this being my first watch through of the show I was blown off my chair with how well this show blends comedy with dramatic moments. You'll be having a great time enjoying the comedic aspects of the show such as: The Playbook (S5E8). But then the next you'll be finding yourself completely distraught feeling for the relationship and well-being of a certain character(s), for example: The Time Travelers (S8E20).Furthermore, some events that take place within the show are sometimes shown like they have little to no-impact on the story, but in reality they have some of the deepest/creative writing. Once again this is shown in The Time Travelers (S8E20).However, the ending to this show is one of the most polarizing in television history, and for good reason. At first look it seems as if the writers wanted to go with a plan they had come up with years prior to the season finale, which in retrospect seems logical... but only if it took into account the character development that certain characters had gone through.Nonetheless, if the ending isn't a good enough ending for you, the writers created an alternate ending that you can view on YouTube that a lot of fans agree ends off on an upbeat note.\n",
      "1 \t\t I am a person who rarely watches sitcoms or TV shows in general. Yet, this entire series was not only a delight but also so wholesome. I cannot describe how much I have enjoyed the entire series. Although I really liked Neil Harris, the commitment that Ted had was something to be amazed at. I am so very glad he finally found the love of his life, for it was worth the wait. Ted Moseby, we will always miss you and your short but to the point stories.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is one of my favorite TV show. I have lot of fun seeing it. Each character is perfectly done and It's incredible that so simple story has so many elements to have people wanting to know more details about the life of these guys.Ted, the dreamer, Marshall the sweet man (perfect for women), Lily, the crazy girl that says everything she thinks. Barney, the worst man of the world and Robin my favorite girl, and perfect for many others, sometimes looks shy but can be so crazy.Women in the TV series are like other men, and act as brothers, they act with open mind. In certain way, each one are different. One wants a family and other do not.The men show 3 typical types: the family guy, a man that does not want a relationship and the normal one.It's recommended if you want to have fun!\n",
      "1 \t\t Five friends, their lives, their ups, their downs. HIMYM consists of every single emotion that can possibly be expressed by humans. The story has comedy, romance, drama and action all packed in. The build up is amazing and the narration is just great. I feel in love with it right from the very first episode. Every episode has a moral, every episode gives one a better perspective of looking at life. One might find many glitches in the series, many goofs in the play, but one must understand that the focus of the series is not on how well it is directed. The focus is on the script, the characters. The characters are so well made up, you feel that you are a part of them. I waited long after season 9 was released to watch the last season just because I did not want it to end. Yes, that is the impact that it made in my life. Watching the series was one of the best things that happened to me and I would recommend every single person to watch it. I gave it 10 on 10 because once you understand the depth of it, you wont even bother looking at its downsides. It is just perfect and a life changer. Simply the best.\n",
      "0 \t\t The way the story started inspired me to watch till the ending which I hated the most. I wondered for many nights how it was going to end. But they messed up the whole thing in a single episode which I waited for from the very beginning. The casting is super good I am addicted to the way each character's life runs. It's a great disappointment to the characters that played. The storyline didn't do justice to the cast's life except for Lilly and Marshall. These two are the star of real the whole show, they stand apart from the other characters. Directors did put in a hefty amount of money and time, yet all they got is a bad impression.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother (2005-2014) is one of the best sitcoms of the 2000s, which is able to move and entertain at any time and that makes his characters passionate thanks to the great performances of the cast.The quality of the seasons, in my opinion, is almost growing and the final despite being controversial and divided the community by me was appreciated.During the vision I recommend to search on the net also the blog of Barney (really exists) and once the series ends I recommend to see the spin-off \"How I Met Your Father\" (2022- ongoing).If you ever decide to see the series I promise you that it will be legen...wait fot it...dary.\n",
      "1 \t\t Many are confused, complaining and outrageous with the way HIMYM ended. But for me, the writers gave justice to the characters. From the very beginning, it was Ted & Robin who were really meant to be. Yes, Tracy the mother was one hell of a woman and she was quite the girl for Ted; considering all the things they have in common and the previous could-have-been meet ups of the two. But despite all these destiny thing, Robin was everything for Ted and all of us knew that from the very beginning. We could never deny that in our lives, there will always be that one person who will mean the world to us but for reasons we don't usually know why, we just couldn't have them. Someone who will let us believe in true love again. That someone who will push us to go out from our comfort zones and be a risk taker but the same person who will break our hearts little by little until we become numb to anything that hurts us. So if the show ended distinctly, I mean, if the mother did not die plus Robin and Barney did not have a divorce which paved the way for Ted and Robin to rekindle the love, I know, some of us will have that question in our minds? \"What could have happened if Ted and Robin ended up together?\"HIMYM was, is and will be the best TV series for me. It taught me many valuable lessons in life even though in a joking way. Ted, Robin, Barney, Lily and Marshall will always be my virtual friends and the things I have learned from them will never be forgotten. I loved and enjoyed this series because I constantly identified myself with Ted Mosby, that person who never gets tired of pursuing his dreams and finding the love of his life. My Robin Scherbatsky sucks but I am hoping to have an ending like that of Ted!\n",
      "1 \t\t I just finished watching the show for the second time and I was enlisted by this show watching with a fresh mind as I have watched it too young for the first time when watching it again it made me realize how much more depth and challenges each character goes through during the show. There is a few episodes during the show that really show how much emotions and depth the characters have and with all this it really puts an effect on you into becoming attached to this masterpiece of a show. I will contend anyone who try's to name a better sitcom in all of existence than this show as it has its sad moment and it's happy moment and it is just an all around emotional pulling masterpiece. So if anyone can say there is a better sitcom you are wrong.\n",
      "1 \t\t Trust me you will just love this series and its characters . My personal favourite is Barney (as I can relate myself with him , we have so much in common xd ) played brilliantly by Neil Patrick Harris . In this show basically Ted tells his children story about how he met their mother but in season 9 we come to know that he was actually telling them something else . (don't worry I won't say and spoil it for you) . The storyline revolves around a group of buddies - TED , ROBIN , LILY, MARSHAL AND BARNEY . This is the core of the series and the best part , you will love it . Now go and watch it !\n",
      "1 \t\t \"How I Met Your Mother\" is easily one of my favorite shows of all time! I didn't actually start watching it on TV until halfway through the first season, but was immediately hooked. From Barney's antics to Marshall's apprehensiveness, there is always bound to be some fun and adventure to be had by the gang. With each episode, I keep wondering when the 'mother' (future Ted's wife) will be revealed, and that just peaks my interest even more. I also love the fact that Lily and Robin did not start out as friends but soon grew to be the best of friends. Lily and Marshall's relationship demonstrates how every other human relationship can be; rocky at times, amazing at others. They are easily one of my favorite TV couples. Granted, there can be some jokes that are inappropriate for children (mostly delivered by Barney), but it is a show meant to be watched by adults. If you're looking for a laugh, \"How I Met Your Mother\" is a surefire way to go!\n",
      "1 \t\t I've been watching How I Met Your Mother from the pilot episode and have been keen to it ever since. All the characters are very enjoyable, interesting and equatable for the viewers. Barney Stintson's character is similar to Jack Donaghy and I love it. The show isn't pure comedy, neither romance, just the right amount of everything. Choosing How I Met Your Mother to watch, you can never go wrong. Every episode is so uniquely put together. It's like a painting, you never get tired of seeing it. Watching this show always brightens up my day. Whenever I need a mood raiser I watch How I Met Your Mother. Simply the happiest show on TV.\n",
      "1 \t\t how i met your mother is a story that i would like to be heard from my dead, this fact make how i met your mother\" very special from other TV shows. I love all of them, they are good actors, funny story, good examples i like the relation of Marshall and Lily how they function as a husband and wife (cuz we use to see on every TV shows that woman are \"very bossy\". i like Ted, he is so nice, he act very good, he is unique character and very realistic On the other hand Barni is OMG he is very in to women, he is so charming what makes him very adorable. and for Robin I think that she is good on the group but not that special they are just perfect together. and one think i would like to add is that I really watch this TV show just to know on the end who is going to be the mother \"Ted's wife\". and are she gonna like dogs, 2 children etc etc. For Barni i believe he is going to marry Nora.\n",
      "1 \t\t As one of another member commented. This show is indeed one of the best shows in a long time! It's hilarious. It shows the friendship of 5 adults with very different personalities (i mean except Lily and Marshal, who can be considered as one).If you are having a crappy day, this is the show to watch to make you smile. Even if you are having an 'awesome; day, this is still the show to watch!!You will fall in love with the dependable couple (Lily and Marshal), with the Canadian chick (Robin), with the needy guy in search of the 'one' (Ted) and with the jerk, yet at the same time awesome (Barney)it is a show to watch!!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t This past season had too many bumps and hooray that Robin and Barney get together especially since she dumped him again for another lover and then dumped the lover.Earlier this season,Ted wants to get back together and she says NO! She is revealed to be Barney's bride and also Ted is supposed to meet his wife in this episode, so I thought. I doubt if it is Victoria , an ex!1 I think that Ted will or did meet the mother of his kids at the wedding. Hopefully, we will see it next season. However, I think the whole series is that Ted is talking about his wife to the kids because she died and he is assuring them about his devotion to her. Because Robin always seem to be his fall back, I think she may be the new wife and step mother.Remember they had a pact to marry each other if single by a certain age. Divorce and widowed are considered single. Sorry If this theory offends anyone!!\n",
      "1 \t\t The greatness of How I Met Your Mother is how they fit so well together. And I know most people say this, but it really is like the new Friends(#2 on my list, b-t-dub). That is also why I do not like people who watch 2 episodes and then scream out on for instance social networks that \"Barney rules!\". I mean, yeah, he totally does, but what makes him, as well as the show, awesome is their chemistry. The way the comedy is used in this show is fantastic, with the use of the rich and awesome Barney Stinson, the hard-working lawyer Marshall Eriksen, the sweet little kindergarten worker Lily Aldrin, TV-reporter and Canadian Robin Scherbatsky and last but not least, Ted Mosby(no, not the porn star), architect and fun guy. Some of my favorite things in this show is how well Ted and Marshall know each other, how Marshall and Lily can communicate, the will they-wont they of Ted and Robin, the awesomeness of Barney \"The Barnacle\" Stinson and other relationships as well as how Barney, who is high up in his company, can in some areas, be so stupid, and how Ted is so pretentious.I can easily say that if you start watching it, you will get hooked..There is one thing you need to know, especially if you are starting to watch the show..: Even though the show is called \"How I Met Your Mother\", don't just expect to see the mother. The thing is, it's a TV-show which is about a father telling his two kids the story of how he met their mother. To explain this shortly, I'll just say; It's not the destination that counts, it's the journey\".Just to assess how much I love this show I need to go back to the beginning. I started watching How I Met Your Mother after one season had aired. Since I am 17 now and live in Norway, at that time it was not familiar to, well, anyone in Norway. So I figured, what the fudge, I'll give it a try. And as the first episode premiered on my iPod, I couldn't let it go. I was just obsessed and needed to see all of it. Since then I've been hooked.\n",
      "1 \t\t I can truly say that this would have to be one of the best TV series that I have watched! This is not an exaggeration either. I recently finished every season of How I Met Your Mother, and I can say that it was an emotional journey which was well worth it. Unlike many other comedy TV Shows, this one is different. This show is just simply amazing! The idea that what could be a simple story, can be spread out over 9 seasons in such a clever way is amazing and deserves acknowledgment. I would rate this show 100/10 if I could because it is just amazing! If you have not seen the show yet, Then you must because it is a must watch! Thanks for reading my review, 100/10, Amazing amazing amazing!\n",
      "1 \t\t The journey of Ted is finally over, he finally met the Mother. The finale of How I met your mother was a very important episode to complete the circle after nine seasons. However, it seems that many fans are disappointed by this episode. I am one of those disappointed fans, and I'd like to write about this without simply blaming, insulting, underestimating the creators and the writers. I think that the creators wanted to take a risk, by finishing the series with an unexpected (for most of the fans) ending. It could have been considered as shocking, if the entire 9th season was not about the marriage of Robin, and if Ted did not try to take Robin back on each occasion (other than in the episode \"Sunrise\" where Ted let go off this love). But it was all about Robin, and as the daughter said \"I don't buy it\". Indeed I didn't buy it either, and that's exactly why I think that Ted not ending up with Robin would have been shocking. My disappointment was more about characters than the ending itself. Let's start with Ted: After nine seasons and countless loves/defeats, it seems that he learned nothing at all. Other characters changed, grew up, learned from their experiences, but not Ted. I had the feeling that all the stories he told to his kids were in order to tell that their mother was a very important person for him, but never more important than their aunt Robin. Tracy: We learned her name at the end; this was understandable in order to keep her mysterious. But other than the episode \"How Your Mother Met Me\", she has never been an important character, even in the finale. This can be explained as \"the kids already knew the details about their mother after their parents met, so they didn't need more stories than these\", but, we, the audience didn't know her at all, waited to know her for 9 seasons, and finally didn't have the chance to have a close look at her. As a result, we know her less than some occasional characters like \"The Blitz\", Daryl LaCorte, or some of Ted's/Barney's/Robin's girlfriends/boyfriends. She may have died at the end, but I think that her character should have been developed more, at least as much as to make the audience sad when we learned that she passed away. Barney: Within the group, Barney is the one who changed the most. He went from a womanizer to a romantic lover who followed his wife everywhere in the world despite not being respected/trusted. At the end he says, \"If it didn't happen with Robin, it won't happen with anyone else.\" He was so committed to this relationship that Barney in the beginning of the series and at the end is not the same person anymore. And this should be this way for characters especially in series; you have to show the change (unlike Ted who didn't move even a step despite all that he lived). Nevertheless, this change doesn't seem enough; I think that a cherished character as him should have ended up happily with the love of his life, the woman who changed him into a good person: Robin. My opinion on him is that this ending wasn't planned from the beginning of this show, but for having him in the center of \"How I met Your Dad\" (Maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I feel, the ending of HIMYM was sacrificed for the beginning of HIMYD!) Let's do like Ted, and finish our review with Robin: Robin was another beloved character of the show and I think that she didn't deserve an ending like this. She should have ended up with a man, who gave up everything for her, such as Barney. Like Ted, she ended at her starting point, living with her dogs, for her career, and falling for a blue French horn... (A beautiful image on its own, but a failure in the name of character development.) If this disappointment was in whatsoever episode in any of the seasons (that we had in numerous occasions), it wouldn't hurt this much, but it was the finale... As I said, I have the feeling that it was a sacrifice for the upcoming series (hopefully I'm wrong). Despite my disappointment with the finale, my final words are a huge Thank You! to the creators, writers and all the cast & crew of this lovely show...\n",
      "1 \t\t \"How I met your mother\" made me realize a lot of important stuff about my own life. It was the most amazing and hilarious TV show I've ever watched. I have to admit that when I started watching it, I expected a hotter main character, but by the end of the series I realized that Ted Mosby is extremely handsome and attractive. And not only that, but his behavior with his friends and his girlfriends convinced me that Ted is absolutely amazing. The actor Josh Radnor made me love \"How I met your mother\", and Barney was so amusing that now I go to every premiere of a movie with Neil Patrick Harris. I totally recommend \"How I met your mother\" because it's not just an ordinary sitcom that will make you laugh and then you'll forget it, it's a way more unusual experience with awesome and legendary characters that you will remember forever. The whole story is presented using flashback, which as the actor Josh Radnor said, \"It makes me realize that the time that I am living now, these are gonna be my memories. And this makes me more present in my life. It makes me appreciate it more.\"\n",

      "1 \t\t When I was first introduced to the show by a good friend around 2006, I thought little of it.I always feel weird watching something when the guy who suggested it, has already seen it and sits besides me. plus I found the first viewing of the pilot shallow, did not like this Barney dude, found him too flat & way too cool.Until recently. - I saw episodes 21 and 22 of the Seventh season. After that I was hooked & wound up watching the whole thing.I realized they developed rich main characters with a depth I did not imagine at first. The main characters all have their special traits, no one really is exactly like the other. They evolute (\"is that even a word?\") a lot from where they start off. Grow up or mature might be what I am looking for here...The general idea is very similar to Friends. But I liked that idea so no harm done there. I look forward to the twists - which are sure to come - of the next season. I feel they cannot go wrong with the plot. Not with that cast - I doubt that cast would agree to let this story have an unsatisfying finale.\n",
      "1 \t\t I just came here to say that for me ''How I met your mother'' is the greatest show ever! Everyone (specially people under 40s) should see it. It teach us, in very funny way, many life lessons and it really makes you relax and appreciate a series. It makes you wish and want friends like those, but honestly we are lucky to see and learn with them, although it's (obviously) just fiction. How I met your mother changed my perspective of life, in a very good way, and I'm really thankful and that's why I'm here writing this just to recommend to all world and say thank you to the amazing producers and actors that made this awesome series. :)\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a classic sitcom. It seems like a lot of effort goes into creating each episode and its paying off. Shots and scenes are apparently rehearsed and shot until the comic vision is delivered. The characters are all adorable and the cast is gorgeous. The actors are all totally likable and even though the dialog is structured they are fluid and make you laugh. I really enjoy this show. My only criticism is that the characters are not very natural. For a show about a bunch of friends, I don't get the feeling that I could be their friend. Perhaps this is the result of a performance that has been too planned and has become contrived. In the end I enjoy the show and respect that its a well made program but I don't love it.\n",
      "1 \t\t A crusade for love that enlightens those who've lost hope and need it the most. A real wake-up call for whom the going gets rough, that's what this series represents. With a brilliant script and witty jokes, this epic comedy can lift the mood of every person in the world. The cast is just spotless and hilarious as well as the script, which is filled with many inside jokes and details which aren't lost through out the course of the series. A work of art which holds the \"Everything happens for a reason\" cliché as its most important lesson. Though allusive at times to Friends, it never fails to rise to its own originality. The soundtrack is brilliant, relying both on original songs and already known ones, digs up the bottom of the musical barrel and brings back many master pieces which are rarely known to people. This series is a true embodiment of what good comedy and life is all about, I for one will be crushed when the series finale ever comes about yet at the same time I look forward to it.\n",

      "1 \t\t I've been hooked on this show since the third season. If you're a fan of sitcoms such as 'Friends', 'That 70s Show', and 'The Big Bang Theory' this show is definitely worth giving a chance. The humor and characters of the show appeal to many types of personalities. If sexual humor makes you laugh, then Barney is the guy for you. But if you're looking for hilarious stupidity, Marshall and Ted will suit your personality. Most women can relate to Lily and Robin, since they experience situations that everybody goes through at least once in their lives. The only difference between this show and real life is that the jokes are funnier and the characters find themselves in more comical situations. It's basically the life most people wish they had. On top of having hilarious characters, the writing on this show is great as well. Carter Bays and Craig Thomas have been a large part of the writing team for all episodes. They write creative episodes where the humor works, the characters seem relatable, and the storyline holds viewers interest. Since the show is a love story in reverse, we will never know who Ted's wife is until the final season. Each episode begins with Ted talking, in the future, to his children about how he met their mother. Each story he tells his children relates to the current episode. This in itself makes 'How I Met Your Mother' unique because television has never shown a love story told in reverse.\n",
      "1 \t\t Barney's tie analogy doesn't really apply any more as he doesn't have two girls on the go. When it was first introduced everyone thought it was between Nora and Robin, then Quinn and Robin but now Barney has broken up with both of them and is happily engaged to Robin. So who is the other tie a metaphor for? It could have been a reappearance from Quinn or Nora but in 'Bro Mitzva,'it seems there is nothing between him and Quinn and him and Robin may even be on good terms with her. As for Nora making a reappearance, it could be possible but as the finale takes place shortly before the wedding it would be rushed and won't be very realistic.\n",
      "0 \t\t So here's what I figure.Ted's wife is in college. Barney's half sister is in college. Cindy's blonde roommate is in college.Ted meets The Mother at Barney's wedding. Don't you think Barney would invite his entire family?Do you think maybe \"Uncle Barney'\"......really is Uncle Barney!?I've been thinking this for a while.. Talking it over with my brother, My buddies, My girlfriend. Idk......Just a thought.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is a clever, funny show that makes an attempt to look at the lighter side of life while maintaining a serious aspect as well. I think the reason the show is so popular is because the premise is based on the one thing everyone can identify with: love. The show traces the life of the main character, Ted, and his attempt to find his future wife and the mother of his children. The show is done in a narrative style as told to Ted's future children by future, older Ted. The narrative style allows the audience to be more comfortable with the show and some of its edgier humor. Throughout the entirety of the show Ted believes at different times that he has found his future wife, that he has finally found love. He believes that finding his true love will bring him true fulfillment. Time and time again, though, something goes wrong and the love that he thought he knew and put his hope in, is gone. Ted is even engaged to be married at one point in the show, but that ends badly as his fiancé leaves him for her ex-boyfriend. Throughout Ted's journey, he engages in many one night stands. I'm not sure how he expects to find his true love through that avenue. We are still led to believe that each girl he meets, even those one night stand girls, could be his future wife. We are led to believe that one day Ted will find fulfillment in life through marriage. The ironic part of the show is that Ted's best friend, Marshall, is married to his college sweetheart and he endures just as many hardships as Ted. How I Met Your Mother resonates brilliantly with the audience of today's society. Everyone is looking for love, to be loved and to love others. For most, the belief is that fulfillment will be finally be found if that true love can just be found. So they set off in search for the perfect guy or girl, often times seeking to fulfill momentary desires and pleasures along with the way by having sexual relations with complete strangers. And even when the perfect spouse is thought to be found and the marriage ceremony has occurred, fulfillment is still elusive. Divorce is extremely prevalent in our society. What happens then? What happens when what we thought would fulfill us instead fails us? Isn't there more to life? Isn't there a greater purpose for us than to wander through life searching for a love that will never truly fulfill? There is a love much greater than the love that can be found through a romantic relationship. I wonder if Ted will ever find that love.\n",
      "1 \t\t The reason this show is so great (Great isn't a word \"EPIC\" fits the bill well). This show follows the life of Ted who in fact is the main character but doesn't come across as that because every member of the crew has their roles, (Massive roles at that) and if even one was cut the show would take a bad fall. I have to say that even know we are in Teds land Barney is my favorite character and i can easily say I'm not alone in saying that. Barney is the LAD!! the one who thinks he is the social glue, but his blindness is what makes his character and makes the show what it is and in fact i can't think of a better actor to play that role as Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) as he plays that character in such a way that can only be described as his own and is irreplaceable. Every single member of the group has their own roles to play and its fair to say that it wouldn't take more than one episode to know that. Every single one of them make you laugh at certain points and that's the reason this show works because it isn't like the past sitcoms in that its based around one man telling his kids the story of how he met their mother, but the fact that every cast member has their own role and without even one you feel that something is missing.I want to quote it with a TV show that if you didn't find it funny you clearly haven't got a sense of humor. Friends was massive and set the bar for the future in sitcoms to compete to. Friends was probably My favorite and Many others favorite TV show of all time, and the reason I'm bringing this up is that Friends only took place either in Monica's, Joeys and Ross + Phoebes (Not so much Ross and Phoebes) apartment and if not mainly in the coffee house, but you only need to know that a show were they are just sitting around talking and by doing that keep you hooked is not only great acting but a massive achievement for the writers as well, and How i met you mother is in the same boat in that its either the bar or Ted and Marshals apartment. ( Barneys and Robins is in it but not that much)I really cant give this show enough credit. The only way that i can is to say for a show to be on its seventh series clearly shows that their inst a small minority that follows it but basically the world (Massive assumption but that's how highly i rate the show) So for people who have seen the show probably know what I'm on about but for people who haven't I've got one question WERE HAVE YOU BEEN SINCE 2005!!! but seriously i can't stress enough to please try it because i guarantee that you will be hooked from the start.DARY!!!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t i love this show and i especially love barney since his the funniest one in the show!!!his relationship with Quin was OK!i especially loved the part were he proposes her in the airport!!! i love lily and Marshall's baby's name :Marvin Wait-For-It Eriksen!!!!the name is SO cool!!!i hope they make more seasons of this show because its a totally must-watch show!!!i wonder if Ted ended up with Robin because i didn't watch the last two episodes so I'm on my way to download all the seasons of How I Met Your Mother right away!!!!i would recommend everyone to do the same!!!!i watched a bit though and they showed Ted running from a wedding with a girl I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE GIRL IS!!!!but when he's ready to get married to her in the end he see's Robbin in a bridal dress!!!!!!!!and it finishes!!!!i really hope this means those kids are Teds AND ROBINS kids and not Ted AND THAT OTHER GIRL's kids!!!!that would be horrible!!!i really think Quin is perfect for Barney except that shes a striper which kind of bugs him but i like the trick they played on everyone were the ladies kiss each other!!!!eeewwww!!!!wow Quin can be a bit evil sometimes!!ha ha!!\n",
      "1 \t\t Although you may recently feel the scramble of TV series waiting to be watched by you, but it originated in the early days of TV's life. Among the list of the names of TV series you will probably find some names that you've not heard and the names that may ring the bell. Every big fan of TV series would not deny the fact that the names '' how I met your mother'' and ''friends'' bring back some sweet memories . The story of friends living and sharing their ups and downs together appeals to youths and it's the chief reason of popularizing these two TV series. The similar and evocative themes of simple and cheerful life that is depicted in both of them make us, at least once, lost in a daydream of having such a funny life with our best friends. While we were ranging to go about following HIMYM, we may be recommended by our friends to have a go at watching the old TV series, called ''friends'', and it's predictable that at first not everyone embraced it enthusiastically. But almost after passing the half of first season, you feel so into it in a way that you had recognized the weak points and copy situations of your last beloved TV series, HIMYM. The more lifelike plot and memorable dialogs of innovative characters in ''friends'', make it the pioneer in the field of true to life series. And the open curiosity about knowing the 'mother' which even aroused by the title of '' how I met your mother'' leads you to follow even the episodes which bear no relation to the mysterious mother.\n",
      "1 \t\t A great series about friends that makes me want to have them in my real life. It's easily one of the best TV series ever. It's funny yet have a lot of lessons too, a balance between comedy, friendship, and life lesson. This series is definitely recommended, even for those who doesn't like comedy genre.\n",
      "1 \t\t Following the stories of the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives. Also, Ted's searching for love is inspiring, love should be worth-waiting, that's why it's so precious and valuable.\n",
      "1 \t\t Easy laughs all the way. Watched every episode twice already...\n",
      "1 \t\t I remember first time I watched it, I did not find it funny, but I still watched it because it was the most interesting there was on TV. That was 5 years ago. The really amazing thing about How I Met Your Mother, is the story. You follow the characters for 9 years, and in those 9 years, there is a big change. Unlike all other series; \"How I Met Your Mother\" has a storyline! And that is how Ted met his wife. The cool thing about HIMYM is also that you can relate it to yourself. The only thing HIMYM needs, is \"real\" comedy. A few scenes can be fun, but overall, it is not something you laugh at. The actors for this show is also very good! It is definitely the right actors for How I Met Your Mother.\n",
      "1 \t\t And keep watching aaaaaaaall the way to the end....You'll see😊\n",
      "1 \t\t I really like this show and I think it's a rare show that captures both the innocence, humor, and \"difficulties\" of being a 20something American. It's become one of the few shows my wife and I can see together.First -- the cast is pretty good -- Hannigan and Harris are the best and the rest are OK.....but the foils are set up well and, well, in the end, they are good \"Friends\" -- funny I use that word since this show regards the same people, city, and relative subject matter.But I always felt the characters in that show never really struggled -- or, rather, the struggles were always glossed over and forgotten. For instance, remember the time Chandler dates the girl with the fake leg? That was a great, laugh all about it episode....BUT....you never really think Chandler is serious about such a relationship.Take that versus the episode that Ted has a one night stand -- that you know he will try and pursue and feels genuinely remorseful for not handling better. It's another \"unfortunate\" relationship sitcom scenario but it's handled with humanity and respect -- and that's what this show is really good at doing.But, it's not all serious -- as Harris' character will gladly tell you and that keeps the laughs coming.The episodes address well thematic concepts that I think most young adults wrestle with: what it means to do good with yourself and your life, why we have some of the friends we have, settling in love v. finding the best love, dealing with the in-laws of someone you love, the negotiations love demands.....and I've just seen 4-5 episodes.I hope it continues this bent and does not devolve into Friends style triviality. Moreover, as seen by not having the \"mother\" introduced yet -- at least a main cast member is not someone who Ted will be marrying.I trust even older people will appreciate this show and how it captures rather well, amidst humor, the trials and tribulation and victories of being young and am glad it's a moderate hit for CBS.\n",
      "0 \t\t The last episode seems forced and single handedly ruined the entire show\n",

      "0 \t\t Now that I have confirmed (the one time) my email address, I can bug out and write a lot of reviews. So says IMDb. So says me. All the characters are fleshed out and there's never a joke that, at least, the laugh track doesn't catch. Each episode seems to be scripted cleverly. How I met your mother is that kind of programming. This TV program is, at least worth watching. Why has it been canceled? TV executives decide it. They panel together in a close knit room. They discuss. The executives pull a choice. The thing happens all at once. Not quite immediately is what my inner voice says. Finally the show is off. TV is back to normal. But one program less rich. I have to write ten lines, by the way, which is measured by the actual lines of text of the page, and it is very difficult, I say very, to write a like or dislike review. Traditional style.\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your mother is a TV-series created by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas. The sitcom was released in 2005, and after 9 seasons have ended in 2014. It counts with 4 main characters: Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor), Marshall (Jason Segel), Robin (Cobie Smulders), Barney (Neil Patrick) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan). The series was nominated for 2 Golden Globes, another 25 wins, and 91 nominations.\n",
      "The episodes are compound for the histories told from Ted Mosby for her children, where he tries to tell the history behind how he met their mother through his personal history and his best friends. All of it is translated on a comic, chaotic, sad, and romantic episodes; retracting just like life is: with ups and downs.\n",
      "Upside: It is a good way to distract yourself. The screen time is just enough, not so short or so long. The exact amount to relax and don't lose much time.\n",
      "Downside: It reveals how deep life could be, and how everything can change suddenly. Maybe you would be absorbed by the climax and feel bad sentiments when things happens.\n",
      "This series fallowed me in a difficult time of my life when I moved to a new city to continue with my studies. HIMYM has helped me to overcome the hard days and the cast has become a part of my family. I totally recommend it, besides it is a good way to relax, laugh a lot, and of course, entertain with a good story.\n",
      "1 \t\t Comedy-wise, the show was really good, a lot of funny jokes and the idea behind it amazing. But I think they just kept on trying and trying too hard at times, all the twists and changes that went on and on and on seemed to me a lot to take on, to the point where every new last-second re-lighting of any kind of fire between that crazy love triangle of Ted-Robin-Barney made me go nuts. It just seemed too much and too unrealistic. How many times can some persons mingle and jingle come on?? And also the ending which everyone frowns upon...absolutely disappointing... you make me watch 8 seasons to find out the amazing love-finding of Ted and you talk about it briefly and then...die???????? Ok the show annoyed me because of toooooo many ups and downs but that last down was really really down.\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is perfect right until the very end, OK, maybe not the last 6 or 7 minutes but I can live with that. So many years waiting to meet the mother and when it finally happens she is just perfect. I didn't know Cristin Milioti, the actress that play Tracy McConnell, but I feel in love the first second I saw her.\n",
      "1 \t\t Series is one of the most beautiful, creative director, was able to make vivid characters, the story strongly interconnected, although most of the representatives reiterated, however, that the director was able to build their characters, but most of them did not benefit from the series in order to succeed in other places ... Personal best in my opinion, is Barney, intelligent quick-witted, has a sense of humor, and actually revolves around the story and is not about Ted or Robin In my opinion, \"Lilly\" is the weakest in the series, followed by Marshall. The story interconnected You should watch episodes basic arranged It can not be viewed by children, but it does not contain abrasive scenes You can not understand the characters across sections placed on YouTube You must view it through the DVD sequential manner\n",
      "1 \t\t Now the season is completed, its like some part of heart is feeling empty. It will take at least a week to normalize again. The ending was some how seems to be perfect. After watching friends and this show i don't think i will like any other shows in this category.When i finished friends i was searching for shows like this one. But after recommendation from a lot of peoples i finally started watching this. It was like and addiction to watch this season. after first season you attached to characters emotionally. The bond become stronger from season by season. Al tho season 7-8 irritate us because we are in hurry to see the secret character, but the final season worth every second of time spend to see this season. Thanks to director and other staff to make it so wonderful. Now i am again searching seasons like this.\n",
      "1 \t\t This is the most entertaining,realistic and kick-ass TV SHOW ever.Each and every characters in the show seems to be very close to your life which makes this show very realistic. One of the characters which i am most impressed is with is 'Barney'. What an amazing character,talent and LEGEN wait for it DARY.I was the happiest viewer to see Barney and Robin getting Married. The episodes involving their Marriage is the most enjoyable,thrilling,entertaining and emotional ones of all.The last episode really did disappoint me for below reasons and i could not get over from it for few days.1. Barney and Robin getting separated.After barney realizes that he is fed up of picking girls and he really did want to get settle.He will be realized by TED's future Mom Tracy.When everything is working fine - Why we have sad ending for Barney's character.2.For leaving Barney's character in dark at the end which was full of colors through out the seasons, which was one of the reasons this series went on till 2014.\n",
      "0 \t\t This TV series was an amazing accomplishment.Was... it was absolutely astonishing how they kept this show going for 8 years. but they ruined the whole thing at the end when the mother dies... and then he gets back together with Robyn. It was an absolute disappointment to have to watch that television show for 5 years and have to deal with that ending. i feel sorry for all those actors that and to get judged saying 'why would you finish that television show that way' and 'this was a disappointment to all television shows.' On the directors behalf. not saying that this show was an absolute disgrace because it wasn't everything but the ending was an absolute journey. i loved how it was based off how a man spent 8 years telling his children word for word how he literally met his mother but one thing i didn't understand. In some episodes, Ted was talking to his kids, and the mother started talking. but when i saw that she died in the end, wouldn't he be telling his kids so they could remember what a wonderful woman she was because in the story she just dies out of nowhere. its confusing so if you understand please tell me.\n",
      "1 \t\t the down and up of life mostly up (so it could remain a Comedy),the unexpected way of destiny to bring you to your goals or dreams. just a deep look of a TV Series with a few word,in my opinion. Barney,Ted,Marschall,lily and Robin make you feel you are one of them \"one of the gang\" . I highly recommended it.Enjoy it\n",
      "1 \t\t When I saw the first episode of HIMYM, I was already in love. The humor in the show is awesome, and so is the history. All of the episodes is about something relevant, and it is fun every time. The funny pervert of a Barny, the genius Ted, the always happy Marshall, Marshall's sweet girlfriend Lily and Ted's love Robin. Even though they are making fun of each other, they are always good friends. The episodes is just being better every time, even though it's not everyone's view on it. Many people is finding the end very bad, but i don't think it sucks. It's obvious that Ted has to be with the girl, that he has been in love in for 9 seasons.\n",

      "It was legendary!\n",
      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is the 'Friends' of the decade, however, in my opinion the main characters were a lot less likable. I completed watching the show in a short space of time and perhaps that's why I became bored; Ted turned whiny, desperate and frustrating to watch, and Barney's jokes became increasingly monotonous and cringe-worthy - the playbook, for example. Don't get me wrong, I loved the show, the first one-five seasons were great but the final few seasons seemed forced and repetitive. For me, the highlight of the show was Lily and Marshall - Hannigan and Segal are brilliant, and fantastic on screen together. Marshall's musical scenes have me crying with laughter. Overall, I would rate the show a 9 out of 10 - the first five seasons being a ten and seasons 5-9 a 8.5.\n",
      "0 \t\t So see I just finished HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER and at this point you're probably thinking \"oh this is about the ending and how she hates it\" well you know what your half wrong. See I started the show and I had a favorite and over time I loved all the characters. I loved them in sickness and health both theirs and mine. I cherished each one as if I was their own mother. Okay the brilliant writers did a literary genius with this show. And then what happens when the end approaches? The show gets better and better and you as a viewer are thinking what could go wrong and you let your guard down. And then guess what happens?!? EVERY THING GOES WRONG!!! OK EVERYTHING. THERE WAS GOING TO BE A HAPPY ENDING AND THEY RUINED IT. So naturally you get mad at the writers... why did they have to ruin such a legendary (himym reference) show. So u are angry at them for ruining a fairy tale ending. But then you realize that's what the authors/writers wanted all along to show you that life doesn't end up the way you want it. And then you get mad at yourself for getting mad at them in the first place. After all they were just presenting the truth of life. It'a not fair that the show didn't end well...let me rephrase it didn't end in a fantasy. It's like a bad electric song, you know the whole time the song is pumping and is building up to an amazing drop and when the drop gets there you're like NO! it's not THE drop I wanted. But its always the drop that happens in life.\n",

      "It was better if the story end within 5 seasons or less .\n",
      "1 \t\t The first 3-4 seasons of this TV show are just amazing. Very promising,funny and original. I've watched them over 5 times probably, and every time I enjoyed them like it was my first time. For the other seasons unfortunately, I can't say the same.. At some points, the show starts being very emotional and messy. All of the characters's relationships start to mix-up, and I don't even want to begin talking about the last episode(oh god..) The magic in the first seasons was that it was a fun show, with funny actors and very likable. Once they started adding drama to the show, it lost it's touch. But still, here and there you can find some good episodes. So if I have to rate the show, I wouldn't give it less than a 9.BARNEY!! <3\n",

      "1 \t\t How I Met Your Mother is one of the few sitcoms that I could truly love. The characters are lovable and you really start to feel like you are part of their group. It is extremely quotable and is one of the few shows that I actually cried while watching. the only fault that this show has is the 9th season runs a bit long. But other than that it is a wonderful show that you will want to watch over and over. How I Met Your Mother is honestly \"Legendary.\"\n",

And i'm so sad about that he's ends. But in that i see some good moments,i will have more time to do something in my life but not to lost my time for watching TvShows :D Or maybe i will search another one like this, actually i don't think about it :d And i don't know if i will find something like that.If somebody know,please tell me :33 Thank you a lot :333\n",
      "1 \t\t How I met your Mother is a of a man telling his children the story of how he met their mother. The show is lovable and addictive due to the simple fact that every episode brings you closer to finally meeting the mother, making it a binge watchable tv series. I personally thoroughly loved the show but there were some major flaws.Lets start with the POSITIVES1) Barney: Despite not being the main character, Neil Patrick Harris makes every viewer fall in love with Barney Stinson, despite him being a misogynistic, racist playboy who does some very questionable things throughout the series.2) Chemistry: The Chemistry between the characters is off the charts. Lagging only slightly behind Friends, the show really makes you believe these guys are friends in real life. However I must say I do feel the relationship between Barney, Ted and Marshall is much more compelling than Robin and Lily.3) Running Jokes: Private...., LegendARY, Suits, Haaaaaaave you met Ted, Slap Bets and many more running gags in the show make you even more drawn into the life of Ted Mosby and his friends.4) Sad AND Funny: Whereas Friends was more of a comedy and the amount of sad scenes/episodes was limited, How I met your Mother has episodes reserved for make the audience feel sad which is what i think the writers improved on when trying to make a sitcom to live up to Friends. One of the most emotionally hitting episodes in my opinion is where Marshall's dad has died and they are at the funeral. Really powerfulThere are many more positives but i don't want this review to be too long so now onto the NEGATIVES1) Corny: Let's be honest there were some jokes or themes that you watched and you just thought were a little bit too childish (Son of a bish :/ )\n",
      "2) Episodes that were just really bad: Whereas with Friends where it's hard to name a bad episode (obviously there are some slightly boring ones but never any BAD ones), with Himym, certain episodes I watched once and decided i never wanted to watch again.3) Lily Aldrin: I won't go into this too much and i want to really emphasise that there were some things about Lily that i liked, such as her motherly nature to Ted, how she was one of the kindest members of the group and some of her relationship with Marshall. But a lot of her character was there to cause a problem between the other members, and she's constantly do things to really annoy the audience, not to mention she could be very toxic to Marshall sometimes.4) Unlikeable Love Interests: Some of the love interests of the gang were just plain boring, such as Zoey, Natalie, Don and more (again that's just my opinion though some of you probably really liked them)\n",
      "5) The Ending: Yes life isn't fun and the last episode showed that very well but it was a terrible decision for them to end the show the way they did (with the alternate ending being 600x better). I won't go into this too much though because the episode has thousands of reviews telling you my thought process.\n",
      "1 \t\t Sad about how it ended and thought Ted would get married first. Mixed emotions about him going after Robin after his wife died. Wish we saw more glimpses of Traci during the entirety of the show.\n",
      "1 \t\t I've never enjoyed any show like this. The character makes me feel like they are real and has always inspired me cheer myself up. MY GOD I LOVE THIS SHOW.\n",
      "1 \t\t Episodes are short and fun you can watch it everywhere and everytime!Final is really unexpected so enjoy it\n",
      "1 \t\t This show is one of the best on TV, no joke. It has that friends style that you can't miss out on. It's hilarious and will have you laughing through every episode! It has no much amazing running gag's and catchphrases, especially by Barney. The characters are brilliant, though you might have a favorite, you still love the other's. I'm disappointed at the horrible last season and ending but that won't stop me from giving it a 10/10 in my book. If you have Netflix, watch it. It's legend -wait for it- DARY, LEGENDARY!!!\n",
      "1 \t\t After watching 9 seasons I was finally happy that Ted found the mother... And then she dies and he gets together with Robin?! I did not watch 9 whole seasons for that. But I it is really worth watching if you're not interested in the story line.\n",

I like Neil Patrick Harris in this show, one of the best lines in any movie is \"Did Doogie Howser just steal my f***ing car?\" white castle that was a great movie with him in it, I think it was because that movie they decided to cast him in here, his role in that movie is kinda like his role in this show, he does play a bad boy really good, I just wondering how long they can keep the show going how many stories will Ted have about how he met their mother.. I am hoping he will have many more stories.\n",
      "1 \t\t This review contains spoilers. How I Met Your Mother is hands down the greatest sitcom I have ever seen. First of all it was narrated by the coolest guy ever (Bob Saget). It is a show I can binge watch over and over again. I recommend every single person to watch it. HIMYM contains a roller coaster of emotions. You get attached to each and every character and watch them grow throughout every season. Character development is one key factor that makes this show fantastic. The show did air for nearly a decade and you can definitely see how each character grew from the pilot episode to the finale. Barney Stinson developed the most in my opinion. He went from being the creepy sly womanizer who hits on every girl at the bar to actually being in a committed relationship with Robin, having a daughter and \"respecting women\". Ted finally meets the mother of his children right when he was about to give up and left the wedding early to move to Chicago. You get to see the milestones of Lily and Marshall's relationship and Robin starting from the bottom as a Metro News 1 reporter to becoming a famous news anchor with her face on billboards everywhere. Another great factor about this show is how realistic it is and how one can relate to many of the situations that have occurred throughout the seasons. The show gives many life lessons (e.g Nothing Good Happens After 2AM, The Mermaid Theory). The show portrays the death of a family member (Marshall's dad passing), a fiancée or significant other leaving you (Lily breaking up with Marshall and moving to San Francisco), parents getting a divorce (Ted's parents) and even going through divorce (Robin and Barney separating). This show never really gives you a clear love interest. You go on seasons until you finally meet the mother of Ted's children. This kind of resembles how real life dating works. You will go through a numerous amount of partners and meet many different people before you find the \"one\" on average which is what happened to my boy Ted Mosby the Architect. He got his heart broken a handful of times but he truly never gave up. The effect of flashback made How I Met Your Mother the show it is. The flashbacks were comical and were a great way to enhance a joke that was being told and to further the story line. The show makers did a excellent job of referring back to events that had happened to the gang years earlier. I enjoyed watching Ted's, Marshall's, and Lily's college days when they would lay around and eat \"sandwiches\". Another one of my favorite flashbacks was when Robin's father treated her like a young boy and made her indulge in activities of such. Freaking hilarious. The finale of HIMYM had a lot of fans frustrated for a number of reasons. I was probably bawling my eyes out from what I remember. I can't believe they killed the mother off that was so sad! I expected it Tracey was not introduced on to the show until the eighth season anyway. Barney becoming a father was the biggest plot twist. It made me tear up when he was holding his daughter and was telling her how much he was going to love her and take care of her. Ted being convinced by his children to go after Robin caught me by surprise. I think this was what upset fans the most. Even though Ted had found the \"one\" he still went back to aunt Robin. Kind of just portrays he still wanted to bone Robin the whole time. Don't get me wrong the whole stealing the blue french horn from the restaurant and showing up to Robins window just like Ted did in the beginning had me in awe. I guess it is just a part of life. Some people have that one person they would take back in a heart beat no matter the circumstances are. Even though the ending of the show was cunning to many, that unexpected blue french horn scene completed the romantic theme of the show and each and every character had got their happy ending.\n",
      "1 \t\t Ok, i officially have seen everythingAnd I'm sad, i mean this wasn't a series that i just have watched, this was a life that i lived with these guysAnd now it's over.To Marshall and Lily and their happy family, to Barney and his daughter, to Tracy (the mother) and her incredible personality, and to Ted 'Evelyn' Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky and their story, and most importantly to the most beautiful and funny friendship of all time.That was the dream, and these guys made it trueTo how i met your mother 🍷 (but the ending was disappointing, just like Game of thrones, the ending was terrible. so much character development was crushed by two simple episodes at the end)\n",
      "1 \t\t It's a pretty great show but it is little bit not right there is some conversations we all didn't understand so we loved as Barney and Ted as all who wrote it I love the show very very very much and I recommend All day who did not watch it to watch it and enjoy the moments and The laughs and all of the emotion things in the show thank you all\n",
      "1 \t\t At first before i started watching this show i would see it pop up on Netflix and think that this show was not funny and amusing like the other shows i'm into because the name didn't really catch my attention. But then one day i happened to flip through the channels on TV and saw they were playing it so I stopped to watch at least one episode and see if it was interesting and i ended up loving it and i then wanted to watch it from the beginning to know whats fully going on. Its mainly about a group of friends who hangout at a bar most of the time and do all these crazy things, you have Barney who had a mest up childhood but is now an amazing guy who loves picking up chicks and doing challenges. There's Ted who doesn't always seem to know what he wants in life, Lily and Marshal who have been together since college, and Robin who's afraid of commitment but wants to be a huge news anchor. The thing that i would say i loved most about this show would be Barney if it weren't for him the the show wouldn't be as great.Its not just about his looks but like how he has fun and really outgoing. The only thing that i hated was the ending, why would they do that. But other than that it is an amazing show i would highly recommend that you guys would watch this, so many good laughs. It is not on Netflix anymore but you could watch it on Hulu.\n"
